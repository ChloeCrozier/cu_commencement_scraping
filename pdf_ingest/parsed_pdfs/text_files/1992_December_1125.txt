HONORARY DEGREE 
GRADY LESLIE PATTERSON, JR. 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
South Carolinian Grady Patterson has served the State of South Carolina with 
honor and distinction for most of his adult life. 
As State Treasurer since 1966, he has presided over the financial affairs of state 
government during a period in which South Carolina has enjoyed its greatest economic 
growth. A major factor in this growth has been the state's retainment of AAA ratings 
on its outstanding general obligation bonds. Such ratings represent the highest status 
that can be awarded by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation. 
Only a few states enjoy such high ratings, and much of the success in retaining such 
financial stature can be directly attributed to Mr. Patterson's fiscal management and 
leadership. 
Mr. Patterson was born and reared in Abbeville County and attended Public schools 
in Calhoun Falls. He enrolled at Clemson, but left after one year to enlist in the Army 
Air Corps in 1942, serving as a World War II Combat Pilot in the Pacific. After the war, 
he earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of South Carolina and an 
L.L.B. (Juris Doctor) degree from the School of Law in 1950. 
Prior to being elected State Treasurer, he was with the Attorney General's Office 
for more than seven years. He has considerable experience as a trial attorney in the 
courts throughout the state. 
During his term of office as State Treasurer, Mr. Patterson has held such positions 
as president of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers. He has served as chairman of the National Association's Tax-Exempt Bond Committee for many years. He is a member of the National Association of State Treasurers. 
Mr. Patterson is a member of the Government Finance Officers' Association of the 
United States and Canada and currently serves as a member of its executive board. He 
has been a strong supporter of and contributor to the Government Finance Officers' 
Association of South Carolina. He currently serves as chairman of the Public Finance 
Network to address key issues related to tax exemption for South Carolina. He is recognized nationwide for his fight to maintain the tax-exempt status of state and municipal bonds. In this effort he has appeared numerous times before Congressional 
committees. 
During World War II Mr. Patterson flew combat in the P-51 Mustang fighter from 
lwo Jima in the Pacific. He served in the Air Force during the Korean War and again 
during the Berlin Crisis in 1961. He has more than 5,300 flying hours of which more 
than 4,200 are fighter time. He is a command pilot. 
In 1984 he retired from the S. C. Air National Guard with 41 years of military 
service and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Upon retirement, the S.C. 
General Assembly promoted him to the grade of lieutenant general. He was elected 
treasurer of the National Guard Association of the United States in October 1990. 
Mr. Patterson has served as president of the S. C. Air Force Association and president 
of the National Guard Association of S. C. 
Clemson University holds Grady Patterson and his lifetime achievements in the 
highest regard, and it is a special privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor 
of Laws, to him.

The President's Award 
FRANK S. BARNES, JR. 
FRANKS. BARNES, JR. 
Frank S. Barnes, Jr., president and director of the Rock Hill Telephone Co., has 
spent a lifetime of reaching out. 
In his hometown of Rock Hill, he is a former Chamber of Commerce director and 
past president, a member and former president of the Rotary Club, and a member of 
the American Legion, Elks Club, Masons, Hejaz Shrine Temple, and Huguenot Society 
of South Carolina. 
He is a former director of South Carolina Federal, C&S National Bank and People's 
Trust Co. and a trustee of Catawba School. He also lends his expertise to many telephone-industry endeavors throughout the state. A national past president of the U.S. 
Independent Telephone Association, he was honored with the association's Distinguished Service medallion in 1982. 
Like his father, Frank Barnes '15, Frank Jr. received an electrical engineering 
degree from Clemson. After commencement in 1942, he served his country as an officer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II. 
Clemson, too, has benefited from Mr. Barnes' service. With his family, he has 
established three funds for the College of Engineering in support of the Barnes Fellowship, Barnes Lectureship and Barnes Laboratory, all in the field of telecommunications. 
The University is honored to bestow the President's Award upon Frank Barnes Jr., 
a man whose reach has been far indeed.

C. HEYWARD MORGAN 
C. HEYWARD MORGAN 
Greenville native C. Heyward Morgan, president and chairman emeritus of Morgan 
Investments Inc., is an acknowledged leader both in the business world and in community service. 
Before forming Morgan Investments, Mr. Morgan was president and chairman of 
Star Theatres Inc., Star Enterprises Inc., and Star Amusement Co. Inc. and co-founder, 
officer and director of Triangle Construction Co. He has been a director of First 
National Bank - Greenville and of South Carolina National Bank- Greenville. 
Mr. Morgan's leadership has extended far into the civic world. A devoted family 
man, he has still found time to serve as director of the Greater Greenville Chamber of 
Commerce, North and South Carolina Theatres Association, International Gold Cup 
Golf Tournament, Greenville YMCA, Salvation Army Red Shield Club and Greenville 
Blood Center. 
Clemson, too, has greatly benefited from the support and leadership of this 1942 
graduate. Mr. Morgan and his wife, Nancy, have established the H. and N. Morgan 
Foundation Inc. Annual Scholarship Program for outstanding Clemson students from 
South Carolina. 
Mr. Morgan is a member of the Clemson Fellows major gift club and a generous 
supporter of the University's Permanent Unrestricted Endowment. 
For all his outstanding leadership and service, Clemson proudly presents the 
President's Award to C. Heyward Morgan.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Educa1ion, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with Jong, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 11
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson Is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in Its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultU1'81 experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
