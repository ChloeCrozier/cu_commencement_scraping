Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left 
the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris ( 1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of 
a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 
1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in 
Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of 
mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in 
the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, 
his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding 
Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a 
national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six 
major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of 
Business and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the 
College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the Graduate 
School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, 
Georgia 30033-4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, 
Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are 
accredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 
American Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, 
American Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation 
Board, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs 
(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of 
Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education, National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, NRPA/AALR 
Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at 
five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also 
heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the 
State's counties.

HONORARY DEGREE 
PEGGY GARDNER DEANE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Peggy Gardner Deane is a remarkable advocate for quality health care for the citizens of 
South Carolina and is among the most highly respected health-care leaders in the state. 
Senior vice president of patient care services at Anderson Area Medical Center, Mrs. 
Deane is widely recognized for her knowledge of health systems, her skillfulness in 
executing responsibilities and her integrity. 
After receiving a registered nurse diploma from Greenville General Hospital School of 
Nursing in 1957, the Spartanburg native began her legacy of professional excellence and 
dedicated service. She has continued to advance her education at Furman University, 
Duke University, University of Pennsylvania-The Wharton School and Washington 
University, from which she earned an MBA. 
A tireless Clemson supporter, Mrs. Deane has been a member of the School of Nursing 
Community Advisory Board since its inception and has chaired the board for the past three 
years. She also serves on the new College of Health, Education, and Human Development 
Advisory Board and is a member of the Off-Campus, Distance and Continuing Education 
Advancement Board. Her active participation, solution-oriented focus and problemsolving talents have enhanced her ability to advocate successfully for the University. 
Mrs. Deane has made a difference in the lives of many nursing students. Not only is she a 
mentor and a role model, she has provided students with quality clinical opportunities for 
years and is a major employer of Clemson nursing graduates. In addition, more than 130 
Clemson nursing students have benefited from the Peggy Gardner Deane Endowed Nursing 
Scholarship, established by Anderson Area Medical Center in 1990 in Mrs. Deane's honor. 
Mrs. Deane's service extends well beyond Clemson into countless professional 
organizations, including the American College of Health Care Executives, American 
Organization of Health Care Executives, American Hospital Association, S.C. Dean's 
Council, S.C. Rural Physician's Incentive Board, Premier Executive Patient Care Advisory 
Board and S.C. Hospital Association. She has chaired the S.C. Organization of Nurse 
Executives, Sun Health Executive Nurse Council and S.C. Health Care Recruitment and 
Rerention Center. She also provides leadership to the S.C. Upstate Collaborative, a group 
committed to the advancement of quality health care for the citizens of the state. 
Mrs. Deane's dedication to community responsibilities is evident in her sustained 
involvement in and commitment to civic organizations. She became the first female 
president of the Rotary Club of Anderson in 1996 and the first female chair of the 
Anderson College Board of Trustees. She has also served on the boards of the Anderson 
County Mental Health Association, Anderson United Way, Anderson County Heart 
Association and Tri-County Technical College Nursing Board. 
Mrs. Deane has received many prestigious awards for her achievements and contributions, 
including the S.C. League for Nursing Excellence Award and the S.C. Hospital 
Association Appreciation Award for Dedicated Service. 
In recognition of her dedicated service to improving the health of the people of South 
Carolina and in appreciation for her unparalleled support of the University, Clemson now 
has the distinct pleasure of presenting Peggy Gardner Deane with the honorary degree, 
Doctor of Humanities.

HONORARY DEGREE 
HIROKUNI "HARRY" WATANABE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Hirokuni "Harry" Watanabe has a reputation for generously pledging his time and energy 
to worthwhile causes. The positive differences he has made to the economy, the 
environment and the community will be felt by scores of South Carolinians for many years 
to come. 
Mr. Watanabe received his B.A. in economic policy from Hitotsubashi University in 
Japan and joined Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. in 1964. He was based in Japan until 1991 when 
he transferred to Greenwood and was later promoted to vice president of corporate 
planning and treasurer. He was named president of Fuji Photo Film Inc. in 1996 and 
subsequently became senior adviser to the president in 2004, the position from which he 
retired in June. 
His visionary leadership of Fuji has propelled the corporation to great prominence in North 
America. Under Mr. Watanabe's leadership, the Fujifilm complex in Greenwood has 
grown by more than $100 million a year for the past 10 years. What began as a single 
manufacturing facility in 1989 is now seven state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, a 
research and development center and the largest Fujifilm distribution center in the world. 
The company plays an integral part in the economic success and employment of residents 
of the Upstate, maintains a strong environmental focus minimally impacting its 
surrounding area and promotes volunteerism among its employees. 
Dedication to the betterment of South Carolina's communities and support of education 
are evident through the programs that Mr. Watanabe has championed or helped to 
implement. Fuji has established scholarships at Clemson University, Lander University, 
the University of South Carolina and Piedmont Technical College and contributed to the 
Drummond Center for Statesmanship at Erskine College. 
Clemson University is fortunate to have an individual of Mr. Watanabe's stature and 
personal integrity spearheading efforts ro foster mutual understanding and devel~p 
beneficial relationships between the University and the Japanese business/industrial 
community in South Carolina. Mr. Watanabe co-chairs the U .S. Japan Alliance with 
Clemson and serves as a member of the President's Advisory Council. He was also 
instrumental in establishing the Clemson University Fuji Film Ohnishi Endowment for the 
exchange program between C lemson and the University of Tokyo, fostering education and 
international awareness among South Carolina's youth. 
Mr. Watanabe has twice served as president of the Japan America Association of South 
Carolina and is a member of the Southeast U.S.-Japan Association. A founding member of 
the Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, he is also a member of the Advisory 
Board of the S.C. World Trade Center, Greenwood CEO Roundtable, Greenwood Genetic 
Center Advisory Council and Greenwood Rotary Club. 
Mr. Watanabe's visionary leadership and commitment to the state and region have been 
recognized by Gov. Mark Sanford with the 2005 Order of the Palmetto - South Carolina's 
highest civilian award - and the 2003 S.C. State Ambassador for Economic Development 
Award. In 2004, he was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Partnership 
for Greater Greenwood County and Economic Alliance and the Distinguished Service 
Award by the Pharo Marketing Association. 
Clemson University holds Harry Watanabe's accomplishments and contributions to the 
people of South Carolina in the highest regard. It is a special privilege to present today the 
honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to Harry Watanabe.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a 
senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College

Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes 
of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United 
States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black 
and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of 
metallic threadi other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since l960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. 
While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet 
in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' 
larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most 
frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with chat registered 
combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as 
sec forth by their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown 
with four velvet bars piped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The 
Trustees wear a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either 
from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. 
At the ceremony's close, che faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the 
President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the 
close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces 
carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, 
however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made 
of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the 
University colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) and amethyst 
(purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office 
of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and comelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" 
which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They 
display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which 
the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the 
various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. 
C. Wilson of Clemson University.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
