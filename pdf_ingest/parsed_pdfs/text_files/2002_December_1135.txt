HONORARY DEGREE 
MATTHEW J. PERRY, JR. 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Matthew J. Perry, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the District of South Carolina, 
represents the spirit of determination, perseverance and change reflected in the African 
American journey through the federal courts. 
Born in Columbia, S.C., to Matthew J. and Jennie M. (Lyles) Perry, Judge Perry was taught 
that he could grow and accomplish anything he desired if he prepared and worked to achieve 
his goals. 
He decided to study law while pursuing his education at South Carolina State College (now 
South Carolina State University). In particular, he recalls, "A growing awareness of racial 
injustices, many of them manifested by state laws, led me to conclude that I needed to learn 
and practice law." After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1942-46, Judge 
Perry returned to S.C. State to earn the Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management 
in 1948 and the Bachelor of Laws in 1951. 
Judge Perry became inextricably linked to Clemson history when African American student 
Harvey Gantt enrolled at Clemson on January 28, 1963, officially marking the end of 
segregated public higher education in South Carolina. As an attorney with the Columbia firm 
Jenkins, Perry and Pride and legal counsel in South Carolina for the NAACP, Perry 
represented Gantt in the lawsuit that led to Gantt's admission. Gantt's enrollment at Clemson 
was peaceful-a marked contrast to desegregation at other institutions across the South at the 
time. 
In 1975 Judge Perry was nominated by President Gerald Ford and unanimously confirmed by 
the Senate as a Judge on the U.S. Court of Military Appeals. In 1979 he was nominated by 
President Jimmy Carter and unanimously confirmed as a U.S. District Court Judge for the 
District of South Carolina. In both instances, Judge Perry received bipartisan support of both 
S.C. senators and of those from other states. He took senior judge status on October 1, 1995. 
Public service has been the hallmark of Judge Perry's career, and his contributions and 
achievements have been highly recognized. In addition to an Honorary Doctor of Laws from 
Princeton University and honorary degrees from five S.C. institutions, Judge Perry has also 
been awarded the Order of the Palmetto (S.C. Governor's Office), the Distinguished Alumnus 
Award (S.C. State), the William R. Ming Advocacy Award (NAACP). the Distinguished 
Native Son Award (NAACP) and the Spirit of Excellence Award (American Bar Association). 
He is associated with numerous professional and fraternal organizations. 
Clemson University holds Judge Matthew Perry's remarkable life of service to his country and 
to the people of South Carolina in the highest regard. In recognition of this and in appreciation 
for the role he played in facilitating "integration with dignity" at Clemson and in other S.C. 
schools, it is with great honor that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to 
the Honorable Matthew J. Perry, Jr.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. Â· 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son,in,law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four,year 
curricula, supplemented by two two,year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering 
and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and 
the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, 
Georgia 30033'4097; telephone number 404,679'4501) to award the Bachelor's, 
Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are 
accredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 
American Council for Construction Education, American Society of 
Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accredi ta ti on Board, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Industrial 
Technology, National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National 
Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, 
NRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and 
Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land,grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reignetl-1 
Ever in our lives.
