HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
WALTER THOMPSON COX 
No name has been more closely identified with the history of Clemson 
University throughout the past half-century than that of Walter Cox, truly a man 
for all seasons. 
His personal warmth and sincere interest in the welfare and all-around development of students have endeared him to thousands of students who have a deep 
and abiding respect for the man they affectionately call 'Dean Cox.' Those who 
have been fortunate to know and work closely with him have found him to be 
firm, but always fair, a good listener, and most of all, a good friend to have at 
home away from home. 
He always has had the students' best interests at heart, and many parents 
probably have rested easier at night knowing that Walter Cox is on the job at 
Clemson, often both day and night. Some alumni fondly recall their first encounter as students with Dean Cox at a rat riot or other good-natured student 
prank. 
Walter Cox's long and distinguished association with Clemson University 
began in the fall of 1935 when he enrolled as a freshman after graduation from 
Belton (S. C.) High School. In the fifty years since then he has ·served the 
University in several administrative "careers." Most recently he was entrusted 
with the responsibilities of the highest office of the University, that of the presidency, during a difficult period for the institution. He served as tenth president 
from July 2, 1985 until March 3, 1986. 
After earning a Bachelor of Science degree (1939) at Clemson, he stayed on 
to do graduate work and play his final year of eligibility on the Clemson football 
squad. He played as a starting guard in the 1940 Cotton Bowl - Clemson's first 
bowl appearance. 
Following military service he returned to Clemson to take on a variety of 
new assignments - assistant football coach, physical training instructor for 
armed forces units, and temporary stints as baseball coach and ticket manager. 
His service as assistant to the president and director of public relations and 
alumni affairs in 1950-55 made him the logical choice to become Clemson's firstever vice president for student affairs and dean of students in 1955. In that office 
he was a key influence in guiding Clemson's transition from a small military 
college into a major, co-educational, state university. 
Walter Cox has given generously of himself to Clemson University for a lifetime. He has done countless things to promote the programs and services that 
have made Clemson one of the most highly respected educational institutions in 
the nation. Everyone who loves Clemson salutes him for all that he has meant to 
the past, present, and future of this institution. We hold him and his undying 
loyalty, love and dedication to this very special place in the highest esteem. 
Any organization would be blessed to have Walter Cox on its team. We are 
most fortunate to have him at Clemson, and it is a very special privilege to honor 
one of our own with the presentation of this honorary degree.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
LOUIS DECIMUS RUBIN, JR. 
Dr. Louis Rubin is the most distinguished scholar in the field of Southern 
American literature today. No one has done more to emphasize the unique importance of Southern literature. 
His 1961 novel The Golden Weather is set in his native Charleston. He 
attended the College of Charleston, earned a B.A. at the University of Richmond, 
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Johns Hopkins University. 
Dr. Rubin has provided the leadership for many pioneering literary studies 
which have stressed that there is something distinctive to Southern literature. One 
of these is the 1953 work Southern Renascence: The Literature of the Modern 
South, which he co-edited with R. D. Jacobs. It shows how the South, following 
World War I, produced a very significant regional literature of international 
importance. 
Altogether he is the author or editor of more than 30 books on the South, 
Southern literature, and such Southern writers as Thomas Wolfe, Ellen Glasgow, 
and the Fugitive Poets. His most recent book is the currently acclaimed The 
History of Southern Literature, of which he was the editor-in-chief. 
However, the accomplishments of this versatile individual go far beyond 
literary scholarship. Many know him as a former newspaper man of many years 
who, among other assignments, served as associate editor of the Richmond News 
Leader under James J. Kilpatrick in 1956-57. 
Others know him for his excellence in the classrooms at Johns Hopkins, 
Hollins College, and at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill where he 
pas been a faculty member since 1967. In 1972 he was named University Distinguished Professor of English. 
Dr. Rubin also is an enthusiastic sportsman who loves boating, fishing, and 
baseball, and some of his younger admirers know him as 'coach' for his work 
with youth league baseball. 
And three years ago he added still another title - that of publisher - to the 
long list of interests he has pursued. He founded and is president of Algonquin 
Books of Chapel Hill, which has been cited as one of the finest examples of the 
new smaller, independent publishing houses in the nation. 
His many honors and awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship, the distinguished Virginian Award, and a Doctor of Letters degree from the University of 
Richmond. 
Dr. Rubin's ties with Clemson University have been strong. He has invited 
several Clemson English professors to contribute to volumes he has edited, and 
he graciously has lectured on our campus many times. He has supported grant 
applications by Clemson's faculty, and he recently selected a member of our 
Department of English to co-edit with him the new edition of Thomas Wolfe's 
play, Mannerhouse. ' 
Clemson University holds Dr. Louis Rubin and his achievements in the highest esteem. It is a privilege for all of us to honor not only a good Clemson friend, 
but a native South Carolinian who has contributed so much to carrying forth the 
highest ideals in the humanities and in the liberal arts.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to m&n's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the. seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested In the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce anc Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As suc.h, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tigers lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
