HONORARY DEGREE 
HUGH KENNETH LEATHERMAN, SR. 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr. committed to a course of public service more than 35 
years ago that would take him from the local town council to the pinnacle of South 
Carolina politics. 
As Senate Majority Leader, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a member of 
the Budget and Control Board, Leatherman is one of the state's most powerful leaders. 
A native of Lincoln County, North Carolina, he studied civil engineering at North 
Carolina State University. Just two years after earning his B.S. degree in 1953, Senator 
Leatherman moved to Florence, South Carolina, and purchased a small company called 
Florence Concrete. With hard work and leadership, the company grew to a $20 million 
business with 200 employees. Though he retired from day-to-day operations in 1994, 
Senator Leatherman is still involved in the business. He also holds business interests in 
residential building and commercial development. 
Senator Leatherman got his first taste of politics as a member of the Quinby Town Council 
from 1967 to 1976. Searching for a position in which he could serve South Carolina 
citizens beyond the Pee Dee, Senator Leatherman jumped at the chance to run for a 
Senate seat that came open in District 31 in 1980. He won and has served South 
Carolinians since. 
Over the course of his esteemed career in public service, Senator Leatherman has 
remained resolute in his commitment to balanced budgets, public accountability and 
responsible government. Prior to assuming leadership of the Senate in 2001, he served 
South Carolinians with distinction in a variety of legislative positions. He is vice-chair of 
three Senate committees - Banking and Insurance, Transportation, and Ethics - and 
holds the unique position of serving 10 years as chair of the South Carolina Procurement 
Review Panel, during which time he managed the development of the state's entire 
Procurement Code. 
In recent years, Senator Leatherman has been a champion of efforts to enable the state's 
three research universities to have access to more funding and to provide regulatory 
freedom to partner with private companies. He continues to support the research 
universities' role in developing South Carolina's knowledge-based economy. 
Senator Leatherman has long been a great friend to Clemson, supporting the University on 
many fronts, including budgetary matters and special programs such as the Clemson 
University International Center for Automotive Research. He serves as a member of the 
President's Advisory Board and as a member of the College of Engineering and Science 
Advisory Board. 
Clemson University holds Senator Hugh Leatherman's achievements and service to the 
people of South Carolina in the highest regard. It is a special privilege to present today the 
honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr.

The Academic Procession 
Th1: Ac<lJemic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a 
senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science 
Engineering and Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes 
of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United 
States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black 
and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of 
metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. O lder gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. 
While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet 
in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. · 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' 
larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most 
frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered 
combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as 
set forth by their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown 
with four velvet bars piped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The 
Trustees wear a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either 
from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. 
At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
al1.)11g with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the 
President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the 
close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces 
carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, 
however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made 
of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the 
University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst 
(purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office 
of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" 
which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They 
display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which 
the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the 
various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. 
C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left 
the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of 
a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 
1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in 
Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of 
mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in 
the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, 
his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding 
Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a 
national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six 
major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of 
Business and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the 
College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the Graduate 
School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, 
Georgia 30033-4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, 
Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are 
accredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 
American Council for Construction Education, American Society of Landscape 
Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National Association of Industrial Technology, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, NRPA/AALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at 
five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also 
heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the 
State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
