HONORARY DEGREE 
GEORGE C. CHAPLIN 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Clemson alumnus and South Carolinian George Chaplin, editor-at-large of 
The Honolulu Advertiser is one of the most highly respected journalists to come 
out of the institution. He enjoys both a national and international reputation in his 
field. 
As a young cadet in the early 1930s, Mr. Chaplin was majoring in chemistry 
and reporting for The Tiger. He was encouraged to put away his test tubes and 
pursue a career in the written word because his special flair for writing had not 
gone unnoticed by John D. Lane, who was faculty adviser to the student newspaper. Professor Lane taught English and was beloved by countless students. Mr. 
Chaplin remflmbers Professor Lane telling him one day that "he probably had set 
chemistry back a couple of centuries." But Chaplin also credits Professor Lane 
as "the person more than anyone else who set me in the direction my life has 
taken." 
Born in Columbia, Mr. Chaplin moved to Greenville with his family when he 
was about 14 years old. He earned his undergraduate degree at Clemson, where 
he was editor of The Tiger and was a cadet lieutenant colonel of the cadet corps. 
He graduated in 1935. 
Mr. Chaplin's full-time career as a journalist began in nearby Greenville with 
the Piedmont. At age 26, when he was a city editor of the Piedmont, he was recipient of a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1940-41. He first went to 
Hawaii in the Army in World War 11 as the founding editor and officer-in-charge 
of the Pacific edition of The Stars and Stripes, the armed forces newspaper. 
He later worked on newspapers in Camden, New Jersey, San Diego and New 
Orleans (where he was editor of the Daily Item from 1949 to 1958) betore moving 
to Hawaii to begin his long association with The Honolulu Advertiser, Hawaii's 
prize-winning newspaper. When he was elected president of the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors thirteen years ago, he was the first editor outside the continental United States to be so honored. 
After a distinguished career which spanned 52 years, 28 of them with The 
Advertiser, he retired as editor-in-chief on December 1, 1986 and remains as 
editor-at-large. During his tenure at the editorial helm, The Advertiser won more 
than 60 national awards. Mr. Chaplin himself also has received many writing 
awards. Among his current writing projects is a biography of the 133-year-old 
newspaper where he spent much of his career. 
Two years ago Mr. Chaplin founded and raised $200,000 for the Coalition for 
a Drug-Free Hawaii, a respected non-profit, private-sector program aimed at the 
young, their parents, and people in the workplace. He also has worked for many 
years to improve relations between the United States and Japan. In recognition 
of this, the government of Japan conferred upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. 
His biographical sketch has for years been included in "Who's Who in America" 
and "Who's Who in the World." 
Clemson University holds him and his lifetime achievements in the highest 
regard. It is a privilege for all of us to honor an individual who has contributed so 
much to the cause of a free press and to the building of stronger relationships 
among nations through his humanitarian initiatives.

MURRAY M. STOKELY MARSHALL E. WALKER, SR. 
MURRAY M. STOKELY 
In 1936 the architectural and engineering firm, J.E. Sirrine Company, hired a 
22-year-old electrical engineer fresh from Clemson College with Bachelor of Science 
degree in hand. The new employee was Murray Marvin Stokely, who would help build 
the company into a giant in its field and would be elevated to its highest position of 
leadership. 
Mr. Stokely remained with J. E. Sirrine (now CRS Sirrine) throughout his professional career, becoming a partner in the firm in 1954 and an officer of the company 
in 1956. He retired as chairman of the board and chief executive officer in December 
1979. 
He exemplifies the Clemson alumnus who has a strong desire to return something to his alma mater for what it imparted to him as a student. Mr. Stokely has been 
generous to Clemson with time, talents, and financial support. 
He served for many years on the Board of Directors of the Clemson University 
Foundation and is a former president of that organization. He has been a strong 
supporter of the Foundation's Pooled Income Fund, beginning with an initial gift in 
1975 and subsequent gifts through the years. 
Mr. Stokely is a member of the Founders major gift club, the Benefactors of 
1889 and the Benjamin Ryan Tillman Society. Many honors have come to him in 
recognition of what he has meant to Clemson. In 1978 he was recipient of the highest 
honor given by the Clemson Alumni Association - the Distinguished Service Award. 
MARSHALL E. WALKER, SR. 
Clemson alumnus Marshall Walker of Rock Hill retired as chairman and president 
of Catawba Wholesale Electric Supply Co. in December 1988. 
Mr. Walker earned his S.S. degree in agronomy from Clemson in 1941 and 
entered military service in the European Theater in World War II. He served as a bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps, earning several awards for valor. He continued 
his military service with the National Guard until 1976 when he retired as a brigadier 
general. 
Returning home from the war, he joined a small electric supply business as a 
partner, purchased the business soon afterwards and changed its name to Walker 
Electric Co., Inc. In 1948 he started Catawba Wholesale Electric Supply Co. which 
wholesales electrical supplies to contractors and businesses. 
Mr. Walker also built the Walker Electric Co. into a highly successful electrical

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
F:Jllowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Final!)', 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V" ). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the· University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 11
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white. are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
