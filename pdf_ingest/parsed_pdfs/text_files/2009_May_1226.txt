HONORARY DEGREE 
John Bruce Pitner 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Dr. John B Pitner's dedication and innovation 
in agricultural research have touched lives all over 
the world. By working to improve the quality and 
productivity of crops worldwide, he has made an 
enduring impact. 
Dr. Pitner spent 32 years working for Clemson 
University, first as chair of the Department 
of Agronomy and Soils, then as director of the 
Clemson Pee Dee Research and Education Center 
After receiving a Ph.D. in soils chemistry from the University of 
Wisconsin, Dr. Pitner began his career as an agronomist at Mississippi 
State University. He was in charge of the soil-fertility and plantnutrition programs for all crops in the Mississippi Delta. In 1947, he 
was chosen by The Rockefeller Foundation as the soils scientist to 
join four select agricultural scientists in plant pathology, genetics and 
entomology to form a team for the Mexican Agricultural Program. This 
research group was formed to investigate and develop plant production 
practices to increase the food harvest of corn, wheat and beans. Dr. 
Pitner's research highlighted the key role played by fertilizer and its 
optimized use in increasing crop productivity. He trained 30 Mexican 
and South American agronomists to continue this program. 
As director of the Clemson Pee Dee Research and Education 
Center, Dr. Pitner conducted research programs focusing on crops 
such as cotton, corn, soybeans, turfgrasses and tobacco. His paramount 
concern was the conservation of soils and water, and he championed a 
multidisciplinary approach to crop research. 
His work in combining expertise in diverse agricultural fields 
produced results much more effectively and efficiently than the 
methods used at the time. The data from these studies facilitated 
better herbicide performance, superior plant varieties, greater insect 
control and improved plant nutrition. Dr. Pitner's accomplishments 
have been very valuable to agriculture, especially in the Southeast. 
He is co-inventor of a mechanical tobacco harvester that brought 
machine harvesting to the small farmer. His involvement in basic 
research produced recommendations that led to the eradication of the 
cotton boll weevil, which was introduced to the United States in 1892 
and was one of the most damaging crop pests in the history of crop 
production. 
Dr. Pitner was instrumental in selecting, planning and overseeing 
construction of the 2,297-acre Clemson Pee Dee Research and 
Education Center. This center is a testimony to the importance of the 
future of agriculture in the state and a reflection of the University's 
ongoing commitment to high-quality agricultural research. 
In recognition of his commitment to improving the quality of 
agriculture in the Pee Dee Region, Francis Marion University awarded 
him the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, in 1984. Dr. Pitner 
continued to support and provide expertise to the Clemson Pee Dee 
Research and Education Center's programs after his retirement. His 
achievements were recognized by Clemson University in 1999 when 
the center's administration building was named the John B Pitner 
Center. 
Clemson University holds John Pitner's remarkable life of service 
and his support of and commitment to the people of South Carolina 
in the highest regard. It is with great honor and pleasure that we 
recognize John Bruce Pitner with the honorary degree, Doctorate of 
Humanities. 
HONORARY DEGREE 
Hansjorg Wyss 
Doctorate of Engineering 
Hansj6rg Wyss has spent his entire life working 
to improve the quality of life for future generations. 
Whether his devotion and passion were directed 
at helping heal orthopedic patients or looking to 
protect and preserve the environment, Wyss' efforts 
have benefited us all. 
For more than 30 years, Wyss has led Synthes 
Inc., a global medical device company whose surgical 
instruments and implants have revolutionized the 
way surgeo~s treat the traumas that afflict the human skeleton. Wyss 
built the company into a $3.2 billion organization with more than 
10,000 employees worldwide. 
He became president of Synthes in 1977. Until that point, the 
company's internal plates, screws and surgical tools for broken bones 
had been produced in Switzerland. Wyss undertook a vigorous change 
of direction, first building the company's sales force and establishing 
training courses in the United States for surgeons interested in learning 
the new techniques for bone fixation. He also led the firm's global 
expansion by acquiring the two other companies that were selling 
identical products to the rest of the world. 
Unlike the use of casts and traction, internal fixation helps the bone 
heal more quickly, with better long-term results. Wyss maintains an active 
interest in product development. Additionally, his desire to improve 
medical practice is evident in the fact that the AO/ ASIF Foundation, 
a nonprofit he co-founded in 1984, is now the largest medical teaching 
organization in the world. 
While Wyss remains chairman of Synthes, earlier this year he stepped 
down as CEO. He gained more time to devote to his many philanthropic 
pursuits, such as the environment. The Wyss Foundation, for example, 
focuses on preserving extraordinary landscapes in the intermountain 
West and the Colorado Plateau. The foundation has helped preserve 
nearly five million acres of U.S. wilderness. Wyss also serves on the boards 
of The Wilderness Society, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the 
Grand Canyon Trust and the Center for American Progress, as well as 
the Board of Dean's Advisors for Harvard Business School. 
Planning is also under way to launch the National Conservation 
System Foundation, which will devise sustainable resource management 
plans for more than 40 million acres of land overseen by the U.S. Bureau 
of Land Management. It is his hope and belief that this will have the 
same impact as the National Park System. 
In October of last year, Wyss' $125 million gift to Harvard 
University created the Hansj6rg Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired 
Engineering. Investigators there will work to discover the engineering 
principles that nature uses to build living things and use this knowledge 
to create biologically inspired materials, devices and control technologies 
to address unmet medical needs worldwide and bring about a more 
sustainable world. Wyss' gift is the largest individual gift in Harvard's 
history. 
At Clemson, Wyss created the Hansj6rg Wyss Endowed Chair in 
Regenerative Medicine Endowment in 2006 with a $2 million pledge 
from the Hansj6rg Wyss Medical Foundation. The endowed chair was 
matched by the state of South Carolina for a total of $4 million. This 
endowed chair, integrated into the S.C. Regenerative Medicine Research 
Center of Economic Excellence, is aimed at stimulating the discovery of 
new therapies for clinical pathology using tissue engineering, biomaterial 
design, stem cell technology and developmental biology. Addressing the 
management of orthopedic diseases is a focus area. 
C lemson University is honored to acknowledge the eminent 
achievements of this champion for medical improvements and a 
sustainable environment. It is a distinct privilege to honor Hansj6rg 
Wyss with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctorate of 
Engineering.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the governing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr. C C Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
( 1807-1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advGcate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d' affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of 
mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced 
only two four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year 
preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions 
about the accreditation of Clemson University.

Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not 
only in its primary academic program, but does extensive research 
at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment stations 
located in the state. The University is also heavily committed 
to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension, which has professional personnel located 
in each of the state's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
