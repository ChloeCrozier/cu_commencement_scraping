HONORARY DEGREE 
WYLMA ANNE WATES 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
South Carolinian Wylma Wates, an archivist of South Carolina's history and dedicated 
public servant, has mentored a generation of scholars in history and has been instrumental in 
helping to build the state's archives into one of the nation's best. Her story speaks of a life 
overwhelmingly devoted to her native state. 
She was born at Olanta and educated at Olanta High School and Coker College. She 
taught in the public schools for two years before pursuing graduate studies at Emory University, 
earning an M.A. degree in history in 1951. This academic preparation led her to a position with the 
S.C. Department of Archives and History as an editorial assistant. 
She has spent most of her adult life as an historical specialist with the department in a 
career that spans 38 years (1952-1990). As a senior archivist, she was a mainstay for any scholar, 
student, or other individual doing research or publication on South Carolina history. 
Virtually every scholar who has written on the history of South Carolina and many of 
those who have written on the history of the South, whether they were young graduate students or 
senior scholars, has consulted Wylma Wates, and she has guided them to the rich documentary 
resources in the South Carolina Archives. 
She is one of that small army of dedicated archivists without whom scholarship cannot 
proceed. Although Ms. Wates officially retired from the Department of Archives and History in 
1990, she continues to be active in the profession and frequently is consulted on matters of research. 
She attends conferences and professional meetings and presently is writing a book on the Izard 
family of South Carolina, which is under contract with the University of Georgia Press. 
Through her dedicated services, all who are interested in the history of the South and 
South Carolina have been made intellectually richer. Hundreds of authors have acknowledged her 
assistance in their works. 
Her numerous books and articles are all important contributions to the history of the 
Palmetto State. One article exemplifies the virtues that merit the honorary degree. "Meanderings 
of a Manuscript: General Peter Harry's Collection of Francis Marion Letters" appeared in volume 
81 (1980) of the Sou.th Carolina Historical Magazine . The article is less than 10 pages, but 
illustrates the power of the combination of a fine historical mind and long years of archival 
experience. 
The mystery that Wylma Wates solved in this piece is but one example of a long career 
of helping scholars and scholarship. Dr. Lewis Jones, author of a bibliography on South Carolina 
history, liked to say that one way to judge a new book in this field was to look at the 
acknowledgments. If Ms. Wates' name wasn't there, the author probably hadn't done his research 
well. 
At Clemson, she serves as an adjunct professor of history, lecturing periodically to 
graduate and undergraduate classes. She also has guided graduate students through the 
complexities of the state's archives and serves as a constant resource for them in Columbia. 
She was a participant in one of Clemson University's centennial events, reading a paper 
at the Fort Hill Conference on Southern Culture held in 1989. She contributed an essay, "Precursor 
to the Victorian Age: The Concept of Marriage and Family as Revealed in the Correspondence of 
the Izard Family of South Carolina," to a book that came out of this conference, In Joy and In 
Sorrow : Women, Family, and Marriage in the Victorian Sou.th, 1830-1900, edited by Dr. Carol 
Bleser of Clemson University and published by Oxford University Press in 1991. 
It is indeed a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors 
one of South Carolina's native daughters with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent 
achievement in scholarship and her genuine service to the scholarship of the greater academic 
community of South Carolina. 
We hold Wylma Wates and her lifetime achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a 
distinct privilege to honor her with the presentation of the Doctor of Humanities.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, 
Trustees, and honored guests of the University. Faculty enter by college 
and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, 
with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank 
wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have 
received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear 
costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United 
States' institutions are specified by a uniform code maintained by the 
American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually 
mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. 
Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns 
have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have 
sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked 
by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one 
variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A 
second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and 
the awarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the 
hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. 
The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which 
designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of 
the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that 
the Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an 
orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that 
registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, 
ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They 
are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold 
and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. 
At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the 
recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when 
the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of 
Clemson University and must be present at any convocation where the 
University, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any 
official convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, 
carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace 
rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the 
ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, 
thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle 
Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably 
going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, 
with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors 
represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in 
the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for 
the whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of 
silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office" which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the seal of the University 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert 
Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of 
the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the 
batons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the 
lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson 
University. 

Page 9
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, the 
coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this 
institution: teaching, research and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. The 
bottom contains a series of open books representing the concept of 
teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the 
University as it is achieved through undergraduate and graduate 
instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and 
wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as 
well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three 
symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the 
humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a 
white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas Green 
Clemson's desire that Clemson become "the people's university" for 
South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, orange, white and 
gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official colors of 
the University; the inner pair, orange and white, are Clemson's student 
colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-
1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the 
founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at 
the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was 
that of a mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his 
interests into politics and the life of a southern planter, and he soon 
became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served 
as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington 
(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of 
mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his 
support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the 
Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. 
Calhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half 
of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved 
on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two 
four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. 
Today the University has five major academic units. These are the 
College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Professional Studies, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association 
of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Computing Sciences 
Accreditation Board, Council on Accreditations of the National 
Recreation and Park Association, National Architectural Accrediting 
Board, National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and 
Certification, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 
National League for Nursing, and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in 
its primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main 
campus and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the 
State. The University is also heavily committed to a varied program of 
public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
