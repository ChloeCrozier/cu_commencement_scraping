HONORARY DEGREE 
SUSAN GOODWIN DELONY 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Esteemed University leader for two decades, Susan Goodwin Delony was instrumental in 
defining the social and educational cu lture of today's Clemson University. The 
contributions she made to students, colleagues and the future of Clemson are immeas urable 
and resonate in the lives she personally touched and in those who never knew her but feel 
her impact today. 
Dean Delony received her bachelor's degree in 1945 from Auburn University and her 
master's from Cornell University in 1951. She followed her formal education with summer 
studies at Michigan State and the Teachers College of Columbia University. 
Her first appointment in Academe was as an instructor at the Woman's College of North 
Carolina, followed by assistant professorships at Montana State College and Auburn 
University. Dean Delony became the assistant dean of women at Auburn in 1957 and 
remained there until l 963 when she was hired as the first dean of women at C lemson. For 14 
years, she served in this post and was late r promoted to assoc iate dean of students. 
When Dean Delony joined C lemson's ranks, there was a great need for programs, 
opportunities and facilities for women. (They had been admitted to C lemson on ly years 
before, in 1955.) Dean Delony met this cha llenge with resolve and passion. During her 
tenure, she was instrumental in the formation and development of the Residence H a 11 
Program for women and the Resident Assistant Program. In 1969, she brought national 
women's social fraternities to C lemson, establish ing the foundation fo r the successful Greek 
Life the University enjoys today. She helped found Alpha Lamba Delta freshman honor 
society as well as Mortar Board. President Emeritus Walter Cox has ca lled hiring Dean 
Delany "one of the best recommendations 1 made in my tenure at C lemson." 
In add ition co her ach ievements at the University, Dean Delany has provided 
outstanding se rvice to her community. While enjoying retirement in her birthplace of 
Tuscumbia , Alabama, she retains active membership in her church and has served on a 
feasibility study for the Consolidation Committee of Tuscumbia. She is past president of the 
Maud Lindsay Study Club, volunteer of the Tennessee Valley Art Association Guild and 
has served and is currently on the Board of Friends of the Helen Keller Public Library. 
Dean Delony has made it her life's work to establish a high standard of character and 
vision for all with whom she has contact. Her sp irit pervades the campus each and every day 
the University thrives. le is with gre at honor and pleasure chat we recognize chis individual 
who truly made a difference in the lives of students and of chis University during a critica l 
time in its history. We hereby present Susan Goodwin Delony with the honorary Doctor of 
Humanities degree.

HONORARY DEGREE 
ROBERT FRANCIS NOWACK 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
As a teacher, adviser, friend, confidant, colleague and mentor, Robert Francis Nowack 
epitomizes excellence. For over SO years, he has served C lemson University in numerous 
capacities-from the Clemson Little Theatre to the Social Committee of Clemson 
College to being a charter member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He has contributed not only 
to Clemson University, but to tens of thousands of students who now define the cultural, 
socia l and educational fabric of America. 
Professor Bob Nowack, or P.B. as he is better known, received his bachelor's degree from 
Carnegie Mellon and a master's from the University of Pittsburgh. He also attended VP! 
for post-graduate work. He began teaching at Clemson on September 1, 1948, and has been 
here ever since. 
Once referred to by President Emeritus Robert Edwards as "one of the truly great 
teachers in Clemson's first century of service to mankind," P.B. has served under seven of 
l 4 presidents and has won virtually every award the University bestows. He was the first 
recipient of the Byars Award for Teaching Excellence in Engineering Mechanics and the 
Frank F. Burtner Award for Advising. He has been a member of the Order of Athena 
Chapter of Mortar Board National Honor Society, Tiger Brotherhood, Blue Key and Chi 
Epsilon. He's won the National Society of Professional Engineers Educator of the Year 
Award, Tau Beta Pi Eminent Engineer Award, Chi Epsilon Outstanding Teacher Award, 
Robert W. Moorman Award from Tiger Brotherhood, Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award 
and Master Teacher Award . In 1989 he was honored as an Alumni Distinguished Professor 
of Civil Engineering. 
Although highly decorated by official honors and awards, P.B. is best known for his 
teaching style, his relationship with students, his ability to befriend and father. He's been 
known to spend five hours per day just talking with students in his office. He learns every 
student's name in his classes, so he builds a personal relationship with each one of them. 
There are thousands of students who are inspired by his wisdom and achieve beyond their 
hopes because of his encouragement. As one colleague said, "P.B. does more than educate 
students; he makes them better human beings." 
Maybe P.B.'s contributions are best summarized in the words of one of his students: 
"What really sets you apart from other professors is your interest in each of your students as 
individuals, not merely as students. Teachers who take chis kind of approach to students are 
the ones who truly make a difference in shaping our lives." 
Because of his dedication and genuine concern for students as well as his unsurpassed 
loyalty and SO-year service to Clemson University, we are honored to present Professor 
Robert Francis Nowack with the honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

a senior faculty member, with the college bacon, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors chat 
declare the disciplines caught in chat college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows:

Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United Scates wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions a re 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; ocher degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. O lder gowns have sleeves chat terminate at the elbow while 
chose since 1960 have sleeves extended co the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is co replace black ve lvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma ll est, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods co bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood co form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of phi losophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations chat are drawn from heraldry. Notice chat the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military 
regalia as sec forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. Ac the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a pare of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and comelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agricu lture. He had a career as a diplomat ( charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agricu lture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-yea r 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accred ited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, 
Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for 
Management Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors 
of Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, 
and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such , it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
