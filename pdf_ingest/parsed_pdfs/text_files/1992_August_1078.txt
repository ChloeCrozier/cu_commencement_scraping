HONORARY DEGREE 
JAMES CUTHBERT SELF 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
South Carolinian James C. Self, textile industry leader, philanthropist and benefactor to Clemson University, is Chairman of the Executive Committee of Greenwood 
Mills, Inc. 
A native of Greenwood, Mr. Self attended Greenwood public schools and Qraduated 
from The Citadel (1941) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. 
For the next five years he served in the Coast Artillery and was honorably discharged 
as a Major. 
Mr. Self has been with Greenwood Mills for fifty-seven years. He began working 
with the company in 1935 at age sixteen and has held various positions of leadership 
through the years. He has devoted his professional life to setting innovative standards of excellence in the textile industry and in bettering the lives of textile employees. He has served as Chairman of the Executive Committee since 1984. Mr. Self's 
father, the late James C. Self, acquired Greenwood Mills in 1908. The company has 
been under continuous family control since then. 
As president and trustee of The Self Foundation's Board of Trustees, Mr. Self has 
devoted his energies to health care, higher education, youth and elderly activities, 
and cultural and historical projects. 
Mr. Self has been a generous benefactor to Clemson University where he served 
as a life trustee for twenty-nine years. He personally has given more than $300,000 
for various purposes. The Self Foundation has provided almost $1 million, including a 
recent gift of $250,000 for the proposed Student Center on East Campus. In addition, 
Mr. Self has left a $500,000 bequest to benefit the Student Center. 
In 1960 Mr. Self was elected a Life Member of the Clemson Board of Trustees. He 
was the Board's senior Trustee when he retired in 1989. ·He is a Trustee Emeritus of 
Clemson and an honorary alumnus of the University. Mr. Self is a former member of 
the State Development Board and the South Carolina Insurance Commission. 
As a conservator, he has been instrumental in helping. preserve historical and 
natural sites, as well as restoring buildings to extend their useful lives. The energy 
he has expended to help create a positive and enduring legacy for the people of his 
state has been recognized at least partially by the honorary degrees bestowed on 
him by many of the state's institutions of higher education. 
His many honors and awards also include The Clemson Medallion (1985), The Order 
of the Palmetto (1989), induction into The South Carolina Business Hall of Fame 
(1990), and recipient of the Presidential Medallion from Piedmont Technical College 
(1991). 
Clemson University holds Jim Self, his many professional achievements and his 
contributions to his native state and its people in the highest regard, and it is a 
special privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to him.

HONORARY DEGREE 
R. DAVID THOMAS 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Dave Thomas is the founder of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants, a 
vocal advocate for adoption and an American folk hero. Without a high school education, Mr. Thomas became a millionaire at the age of 35 through hard work, perseverance and a burning desire to succeed. 
Mr. Thomas, who refers to himself as ·"a grill man who got a couple of breaks 
along the way," is a familiar face today to millions of TV viewers of his Wendy's 
commercials. His dream of creating a better hamburger has led him to the top of a 
multi-billion dollar, multi-national business in 29 countries with more than 130,000 
employees and annual sales of $3.2 billion. 
He was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but never knew his birth parents. When 
he was six weeks old, he was adopted by a couple from Kalamazoo, Michigan, Rex 
and Auleva Thomas. His adoptive mother died when he was five, and his early years 
saw numerous moves from state to state as his adoptive father sought work. 
"This wasn't easy," Mr. Thomas said. "No roots; no sense of belonging. With all 
that moving, I didn't get a chance to know kids. I guess that's why work became my 
constant companion." But he is grateful for the challenges his childhood presented. 
"Some people see my early life as an adversity, but it created a drive in me. I lived 
to make money, but money wasn't the only important thing. It also was the sense of 
accomplishment." 
Mr. Thomas learned a lot about the fast-food business from one of the real pros -
Colonel Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 1956 Mr. Thomas 
was working at a barbecue restaurant opened by his boss, Phil Clauss, when he met 
Colonel Sanders, a man who became one of the greatest influences in his life. The 
Colonel was traveling nationwide to promote his new fried chicken franchise. Mr. 
Clauss bought the franchise, and Mr. Thomas learned all about the chicken business. 
In 1962 Mr. Clauss gave Mr. Thomas an opportunity to save four failing Kentucky 
Fried Chicken carryouts in Columbus, Ohio, from bankruptcy, make them profitable, 
and pay off a $200,000 deficit. If successful, Mr. Thomas would receive 45 percent of 
the Columbus franchise. "I had four kids and a wife and was making $135 a week, 
but I made up my mind that I was going to be in business for myself." 
The restaurants prospered, and Mr. Thomas added four more Columbus locations. 
Six years later he sold the restaurants back to Kentucky Fried Chicken for $1.5 
million, becoming a millionaire at age 35. Mr. Thomas opened the first Wendy's Old 
Fashioned Hamburgers restaurant on November 15, 1969, in downtown Columbus, 
going against the advice of critics who said the restaurant industry already was 
saturated. He named his new restaurant after his eight-year-old daughter, Melinda Lou, 
nicknamed "Wendy" by her brother and sisters. 
A cause that perhaps is closest to Thomas' heart is adoption. In 1990, President 
Bush asked him to be a national spokesperson for a White House initiative on adoption, "Adoption Works ... For Everyone." In this capacity, Thomas works tirelessly 
to raise awareness of adoption nationwide. Thomas' belief that every child deserves 
a permanent home and love drives him to continue his work to promote adoption. 
Dave's Way, Thomas' autobiography, was published in September 1991. During a 
national 35-city book tour, Thomas had the opportunity to promote adoption during 
more than 225 media interviews and speeches. Thomas has pledged all his book 
profits to national adoption awareness programs. 
Clemson University holds Dave Thomas and his remarkable achievements in the 
highest regard, and it is a special privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor 
of Humanities, to him.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline

Architecture

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. its basic clubiike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Beil, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors. 

Page 24
Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson Is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in Its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located In each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. · 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
