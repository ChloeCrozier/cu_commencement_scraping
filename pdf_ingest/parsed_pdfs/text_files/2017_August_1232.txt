THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a se nior faculty memher, with the college baton, 
described under Unive1 .. iry Regalia. The coll ege banners are placed on the stage . Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Counci l on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate facu lty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin . Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
in ·titutions. Academic co-tu mes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States art> specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctor of philo ·ophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gown have leeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
di cipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hood specify the level of degree, the type of discipline stud ied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
ignified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not awa rd hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the C lemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is pre ently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of C lemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in orange and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in orange for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

where the Universiry, through its delegated members, is acting 
offic ially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the universiry marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president' chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ce remo ny, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the officia l withdrawal of the University and, thus, the clo e of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremoni al maces carri ed by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. !rs basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made 
of walnut, wood harvested from trees that once grew on the 
Clemson campus, and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and 
the universiry colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state tone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and sea l is symbolic of the authoriry 
vested in the offi ce of president by the governing body of the 
Un iversity. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks fo r the whole body of the institution. 
C lemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold , and 
carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from med ieval 
"staffs of office," which were ca rried by the senior member of 
departments of state o r church. They display the University seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. C lemson's baton are made of walnut and oak, both 
woods harvester from trees that once grew o n the Clemson 
campus, and silver with the various disciplines represented on 
the baton. 
The Clemson Universiry regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lap idary work was executed by 
the late Mr.CC Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
C lemson Universiry is named for Thomas Gree n C lemson 
( 1807-1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Phil adelphi a in 1807 and 
educa ted at the Roya l School of Mines in Paris (1 828- 1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge cl'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a 
scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the fo unding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leade rship in South Carolina 
after the C ivil War, and his part in founding C lemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun , a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fo rt Hill, is preserved o n the Clemson campus as a natio nal 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 
with an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" 
announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented by two 
two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has eight 
major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts 
and Humanities; the College of Behavioral, Social and Hea lth 
Sciences; the College of Business; the College of Education; the 
College of Engineering; Computing and Applied Sciences; the 
College of Science; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees.

Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged 
not o nly in its primary academic program, but does extensive 
research at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment 
statio ns located in the state. The University is also hem·ily 
committed to a varied program of public servi ce, including the 
work of agricu ltural extension, which has professional personnel 
located in each of the sta te's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGmiry/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
