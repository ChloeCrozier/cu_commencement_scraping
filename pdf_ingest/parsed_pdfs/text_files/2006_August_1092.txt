HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. 
He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as 
the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he 
published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His 
varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil 
War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. 
Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 
446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major 
academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral 
Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and 
Human Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-
4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are accredited by the AACSB 
International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council for Construction Education, 
American Dietetic Association, American Society of Landscape Architects, Computing 
Science Accreditation Board, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related 
Education Programs (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, 
NRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five 
agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural 
extension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

HONORARY DEGREE 
PHYLLIS S BUCHANAN 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Phyllis S Buchanan has not only demonstrated her personal devotion to educational quality and 
innovation for students of all ages; she has recruited others to take up the cause as well. She 
continues to inspire her collaborators in this important effort. 
Buchanan earned both her Bachelor of Science and Master of Education degrees from Widener 
University. Her current position as manager of the DuPont Office of Education is backed by 34 
years with the company and more than 25 years of experience with its Corporate Education 
Program. 
She has overseen corporate support for science education and leading-edge research at the 
university level, identified and contributed to the development of national programs that 
promote young people's interest in science and technology, and repositioned significant 
resources to support K-12 science and mathematics education reform. 
As manager of this ambitious agenda, she weaves together an extensive network of alliances and 
partners across all educational levels and engages DuPont as a catalyst for reform and 
improvement. Her dream is to educate students today for a more knowledgeable work force for 
tomorrow. 
For that reason, Buchanan has become an ambassador for science learning. She is committed to 
transforming the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines from textbookbased education to engaged and active learning. From innovation to experimentation to 
implementation, she helped coordinate a state-level transition to a hands-on, inquiry-centered 
program in Delaware. This program has helped close the achievement gap in Delaware and will 
serve as a model for other states. 
Buchanan's leadership fuels movements to empower young people from all backgrounds, and 
that leadership has helped produce another highly successful program here at Clemson. The 
Call Me MISTER® program has garnered national attention, and Buchanan was a key member 
in its development. The program is aimed at finding and promoting African American males to 
be elementary school teachers in South Carolina. It, too, is being considered as a model for 
similar programs in other states, and Buchanan's involvement is testament to her role as a 
ground breaker. 
Buchanan is a member of several boards, including the Triangle Coalition for Science and 
Technology Education Board of Directors, the FIRST Philadelphia Regional Advisory Board 
(Drexel University), the National Science Resources Center's National LASER Advisory Board 
and the Science Olympiad National Advisory Board. 
She also works collaboratively with teachers and educators in a number of states, South 
Carolina among them, and actively encourages all DuPont employees to contribute expertise 
and resources to improve science and mathematics education. 
Buchanan's dedication to the welfare of students is not limited to the office or boardroom; she 
mentors more than 20 students in the Pioneer Student Leadership Academy. Co-founder of this 
academy, she works one-on-one with students to ensure that they are prepared for the 21" 
century work force. 
Clemson University is honored to acknowledge the eminent achievements of this champion for 
education. It is a distinct privilege to present Phyllis S Buchanan with the honorary degree, 
Doctor of Humanities.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by irs marshal, a senior faculty member, with 
the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestty, and Life

Academic Support 
Insttuction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval 
origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes 
specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black 
or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer 
than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves 
extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and 
the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to 
replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy 
(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped 
in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three 
velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not 
hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the 
University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the 
University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout 
the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic 
of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried 
by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is 
much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood 
and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors represented 
by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of 
South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" which 
were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the 
seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths 
of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor 
Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of 
Clemson University.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
