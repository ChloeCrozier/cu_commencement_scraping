HONORARY DEGREE 
JOSEPH PATRICK RILEY, JR. 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Considered to be one of the most visionary and effective community leaders in 
America, Charleston native and mayor, Joseph Patrick Riley, Jr., has provided great service 
to the state of South Carolina and ardent support to Clemson University. 
Mayor Riley began his distinguished career as a partner in the law office of Riley & 
Barr. In 1968 he was elected to the S.C. House of Representatives. As the youngest House 
member, Mayor Riley co-authored ethics legislation, election law reform and the creation 
of the S.C. Commission on Human Affairs. His service in the House ended six years later 
when he won a successful bid to become mayor of Charleston. 
During his five consecutive terms as mayor, his bold leadership has accomplished 
extraordinary results, including: a substantial drop in serious crime; a renewed focus on 
racial harmony and progress; a vibrant economic renaissance that revitalized downtown 
and turned Charleston into what U.S. News & World Report dubbed, "the number one city 
where business is best"; and a cultural and recreational explosion of activity, ranging from 
the internationally acclaimed Spoleto Festival to the award-winning Waterfront Park. 
Mayor Riley is perhaps best known, however, for the compassion and effective leadership 
he exhibited throughout the Hurricane Hugo crisis. 
Mayor Riley served as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the only mayor from 
the Carolinas or Georgia to be so honored. He also chaired the National League of Cities 
Urban Conservation Task Force and the Cities Task Force of the Southern Growth Policies 
Board. He was named South Carolinian of the Year for 1990. 
A longtime supporter of a quality urban area, Mayor Riley has championed the historic 
preservation of Charleston's built environment, culminating in his receipt of the 1995 
Thomas Jefferson Award for Historic Preservation from the American Institute of 
Architects, the most prestigious award of its kind. An honorary member of the AJA, Mayor 
Riley helped found the Mayors' Institute for City Design (MICD), a national organization 
which has helped over 350 U.S. mayors learn more about the importance and necessity of 
quality urban design. 
Under Mayor Riley's leadership, Charleston has become the model by which historic 
preservation, urban design and environmental awareness can yield measurable benefits in 
economic development. Other communities look to Charleston for lessons in restoring and 
preserving historic neighborhoods, utilizing the downtown commercial area, careful 
planning for development and transportation, creating dignified affordable housing and 
valuing the importance of architecture and aesthetic standards in the built environment. 
Throughout his career, Mayor Riley's devotion to Clemson has been unwavering. He 
has provided significant counsel and leadership in the establishment of the Clemson 
University Architecture Center at the College of Charleston. He was instrumental in 
obtaining a historic home in Charleston to be used exclusively for Clemson University's 
outreach programs. Mayor Riley served as a founding member of the first advisory board for 
the College of Architecture and has been a significant contributor for eight years. In 
addition to being a guest lecturer at Clemson, he has also addressed numerous national, 
state and regional conferences on urban and rural planning for design excellence and 
historic preservation. 
We hold Mayor Joe Riley and his lifetime achievements in the highest esteem. In 
recognition of his contributions to South Carolina, to historic preservation and his 
remarkable service to Clemson University, it is a distinct privilege ro present him with the 
Doctor of Humanities honorary degree.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts and 
Humanities 
Business and Public Affairs 
Engineering and Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculry follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
chose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degcee. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with pucple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace . At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

+Departmental Honors: The graduates so designated have completed an enriched program of study designed by their 
deparcments with the approval of the Calhoun College Honors Program. To earn Departmental Honors students must 
complete an honors thesis and/or other upper division honors courses, while maintaining an overall grade~point ratio of 
3.40 or higher. Departmental Honors graduates appear in the line of march wearing the Calhoun College Honors 
Medallion on an orange and purple ribbon. This medallion is made possible by an endowment established by Mrs. 
Katherine Inabinet Vickery of Columbia, South Carolina, to honor the memory of her husband and Clemson graduate, 
the late B. C. Inabinet. 
Students wearing the white stoles over their gowns are members of honorary societies that require a minimum 3.00 
grade point ratio for membership. The scoles have the University seal embroidered on one side, and on the other side 
are the emblcm(s) of honorary societies in which the student is a member.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on 
Accreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of 
Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
