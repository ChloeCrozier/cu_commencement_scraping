HoNORARY DEGREE 
James Oliver Sweeny 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Jim Sweeny is a powerhouse. His ability to relate to others and unite many for a 
common cause has been the hallmark of his lifetime of devoted service to Clemson 
University. Among the strongest, most loyal Clemson advocates, Sweeny speaks with 
pride and great heartfelt conviction about his beloved alma mater and the traditions it 
represents. 
The Anderson, S.C., Boys' High School graduate enrolled in Clemson College in 
1935 and wasted no time immersing himself in cadet life. Not only did he try intramural 
boxing as a freshman, but he also participated in the Freshman, Sophomore and Senior 
Platoons. Sweeny was battalion executive; associate editor of TAPS; a member of Tiger 
Brotherhood, Blue Key and Sigma Epsilon; president of Tau Beta Pi, AlEE and the Senior Class; and chairman 
of the Senior Council. He also excelled academically, earning Highest Honors as a freshman and sophomore 
and High Honors as a junior and senior. He graduated from Clemson with "The Great Class of '39" and a 
B.S. degree in electrical engineering. 
Sweeny began his professional career with General Electric Corp. in 1939 but was called into active duty 
with the Army Signal Corps two years later. With the 835th Signal Service Company, Sweeny utilized his 
electrical and radio knowledge to set up radio headquarters in New Delhi, India. He later became radio officer 
in Assam for the Ledo Road operation and was awarded the Legion of Merit for installing a telephone line 
through the North Burma jungle. Back in the States in 1944, Sweeny attended the Command and General 
Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and served as director of the Radio School at Fort Monmouth, N.J., 
before being discharged from active duty as a major in 1945. 
Sweeny returned to General Electric as a researcher in the High Voltage Laboratory and then became 
a design engineer for power transformers. Successive assignments in test program administration, market 
research, product planning and marketing management led to general management of two GE businesses 
during his 40-year career with the company. In 1976, Sweeny retired as strategic business planning manager of 
the Power Transmission and Distribution Division but was retained as a consultant. 
After retirement, Sweeny became an active numismatics enthusiast. He authored and co-authored numerous 
articles on coin-collecting and has written several books on the topic, including the prize-winning two-volume 
reference titled Tempus in Numis. 
Retirement also afforded Sweeny the opportunity to renew his love affair with Clemson. An active member 
of the Alumni Association since his graduation and a charter member of the Presidents Club, he chaired the 
Class of '39 Golden Anniversary Committee. He motivated class members to support three class projects 
including the creation of unrestricted University-wide scholarships benefiting each college, the introduction of 
the Faculty Award for Excellence and an endowment for the Botanical Garden. As chairman of the Class of' 39 
Heritage Gardens Committee, Sweeny guided the completion of the Class of' 39 Caboose Garden, the realization 
of the Golden Tiger-Cadet Life Garden and the construction of the J.B. Montgomery Amphitheater. 
The Heritage Gardens in the S.C. Botanical Garden at Clemson are a celebration of beauty and a testament 
to the vision, tenacity and motivation of Sweeny. While he used his talents to involve hundreds of alumni in 
capturing the history of Clemson through the complex, he personally was instrumental in the design, engineering, 
fund raising, purchasing, construction and management of the project. In fact, he is a driving force right now in 
getting the Founders Garden, honoring Thomas Green Clemson, under way as part of the complex. 
Giving freely of his time, his knowledge, his talent and his resources for the development of projects that 
are so vital to the well-being of the future of Clemson University, Sweeny was named Volunteer of the Year by 
the Clemson Alumni Association in 1998. In 2000, he received the Alumni Association's highest honor: the 
Distinguished Service Award. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of its own sons 
with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievements and meritorious service to the 
institution. It is a distinct privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctorate of Humanities, to James Oliver 
Sweeny.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-
1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South Carolina 
for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated 
at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early 
profession was that of a mining engineer; however, circumstances 
diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern planter, 
and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. 
He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-
1852) and served as the first superintendent of agricultural affairs in 
Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a South 
Carolina political figure of national importance during the first 
half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is 
preserved on the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only 
two four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory 
courses. Today the University has six major academic units. These are 
the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences; the College 
of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; the College of Business and 
Behavioral Science; the College of Engineering and Science; the 
College of Health, Education and Human Development; and the 
Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions about 
the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by MCSB International (Association to 
Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, American Council for Construction 
Education, American Dietetic Association (CADE), American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing 
Education (CCNE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and 
Related Education Programs (CACREP), National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and 
Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 
NRPN MLR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation 
Board, and Society of American Foresters. Documentation 
of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not 
only in its primary academic program, but does extensive research 
at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment stations 
located in the state. The University is also heavily committed to a 
varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural 
extension, which has professional personnel located in each of the 
state's counties. 
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, the 
university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly 
at the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of 
the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages.lts basic club-like shape, however, is much more ancient, 
probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood 
and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the university colors 
represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested 
in the office of president by the governing body of the University. 
Only the university president may wear it, and while wearing it, he 
speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and 
seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university seal and 
the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the 
various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed by 
Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany 
Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The 
enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor 
Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. 
C C Wilson of Clemson University. 
CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
