HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
SISTER MARILYN FISCHER, S.F.P. 
Sister Marilyn Fischer, S.F.P., is Chairperson of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor 
Health System (HSI) and the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation of Brooklyn 
Heights, New York. 
Sister Marilyn, a native of Quincy, Illinois, entered the congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor on September 17, 1958, and made her perpetual vows on 
August 25, 1966. She began her professional religious career as an instructor in the 
School of Nursing at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. 
It wasn't long before her superiors recognized her gift for leadership, and in 1968 
she was named congregational Director of Formation. One year later she was appointed President of Region VI of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Formation Council, a 
member of the national board of the Sister Formation Conference, and a member of 
the Board of Trustees of St. Elizabeth's. 
In 1977 Sister Marilyn was appointed to the health care ministry core group and 
soon after was elected to the leadership board of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor. 
What followed was a sixteen year period of intense study to plan the future of the 
more than 20 facilities the Sisters sponsor in the United States. 
In 1980 Sister Marilyn was elected President of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, 
giving leadership to Sisters and ministries throughout the congregation in Africa, Brazil, Italy and the United States. Recognizing the need to respond to a changing and 
more complex health care environment in the United States, Sister Marilyn united a 
diverse group of health care providers (hospitals, nursing homes, social service centers, retirement communities) scattered throughout six states into one of the largest 
Catholic health systems in the country, with more than 5,000 beds and $700 million in 
annual operating revenues. 
When the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Health System came into being in 1983, 
Sister Marilyn was appointed chairperson. She has led the system through changes 
in reimbursement, through the divestiture of two hospitals, and through several years 
of declining operating trends. Today, it is a vibrant, financially healthy system which 
last year provided care to more than 800,000 people and more than $17 million in 
charity care to the poor. 
Similarly, when the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation was created in 
1984 as the newly formed philanthropic arm both of the health system and the congregation, Sister Marilyn was appointed chairperson. In that time the Foundation has 
raised more than $40 million. As Foundation chairperson, Sister Marilyn helped create 
the Franciscan Health Care Games, one of the largest and most successful annual 
fund-raising events in the country. 
Throughout a long and distinguished career in corporate leadership positions, 
Sister Marilyn has remained, at heart, a Franciscan Sister of the Poor. Always mindful 
of those in need, she more recently has led the Foundation to develop support for the 
Sisters' relief efforts in Africa, Brazil and Italy and is currently leading the Foundation 
through a national $25 million capital endowment campaign. 
She is a gentle, compassionate woman whose lifetime of service to others and 
devotion to prom'oting the welfare of humanity is well known. We hold Sister Marilyn 
Fischer's achievements in the highest regard, and it is a special privilege to award the 
honorary Doctor of Humanities degree to her.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
HARRY McKINLEY LIGHTSEY, JR. 
The Honorable Harry M. Lightsey, Jr., South Carolina native and Clemson alumnus, has a long and distinguished career in South Carolina in the fields of law and 
public higher education. 
His career includes service as Assistant Attorney General of the State of South 
Carolina for ,five years, Professor and Dean of the School of Law at the University of 
South Carolina, and six years as President of The College of Charleston. 
Dr. Lightsey attended the public schools in his native Columbia and earned his 
Bachelor of Science degree at Clemson, graduating cum laude in 1952. He enrolled 
at the University of Georgia to study veterinary medicine and was graduated cum 
laude with a D.V.M. degree in 1956. Dr. Lightsey practiced in Allendale until 1958 
when he returned to school to study law. 
In 1961 he was awarded his J.D. degree from the University of South Carolina 
graduating summa cum laude at the top of his class , with one of the best academic 
records ever established at the university. He practiced law in Columbia for 19 years 
and was an adjunct or full-time professor at the University of South Carolina School 
of Law during these years. He was named Dean of the School of Law in 1980 and 
helped to develop the school into one of the finest in the Southeast. 
He served in that position for six years until 1986 when a new leadership challenge took him to Charleston as President of the College of Charleston/University 
of Charleston . When he retired in 1992, his legacy was a new direction and momentum 
which has helped to move the institution to heights of great success. 
Dr. Lightsey joined the Columbia firm of McNair & Sanford, P.A., in 1992. This 
year, he became a shareholder and chairman of the Litigation Department. 
As a student, he was Phi Beta Kappa and President of the Student Body at Clemson; Editor of the S. C. Law Quarterly; Captain and National Quarterfinalist, USC Moot 
Court Team; Chief Justice, Wig and Robe Honorary Law Scholastic Society; outstanding law school graduate and first honor graduate of the University of South Carolina. 
Dr. Lightsey was general counsel to the S. C. Public Service Commission, and 
legal adviser to the S. C. State Senate's President, Finance Committee and Banking 
and Insurance Committee. His active practice was in the public util ity, regulatory 
and administrative law areas. 
He is the author/co-author of four books and numerous legal articles. He is 
admitted to practice in the S. C. Supreme Court, U.S. Distri ct Court, District of South 
Carolina, U. S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U. S. Supreme Court. He is a 
member of the South Carolina, Richland County and American Bar Associations. 
Clemson University is greatly honored to have the Honorable Harry Lightsey 
among its truly outstanding graduates. We salute him for a remarkable life of service 
to the citizens of his state and for the untold contributions he has made to the lives 
of all he has touched - as a teacher, counselor, and leader in higher education and 
law. It is a distinct privilege for Clemson University to award the honorary degree, 
Doctor of Laws, to Harry Lightsey.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a 
senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American 
Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Dlsclpllne 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of 
medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States 
wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified 
by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually 
mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other 
degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, 
are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 
1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is 
marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are 
black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A 
second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and 
doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width 
of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim 
edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which 
designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice 
that the Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). 
Although many combinations are duplicated by dozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set 
forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in 
gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, 
the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, 
when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of 
Clemson University and must be present at any convocation where the 
University, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any 
official convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, 
carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace 
rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the 
ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, 
thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle 
Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably 
going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, 
with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors 
represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in 
the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the 
whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of 
silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office" which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the seal of the University 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert 
Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of 
the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the 
batons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the 
lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson 
University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, 
the coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this 
institution: teaching, research and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. 
The bottom contains a series of open books representing the 
concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The 
white of the books and the purple of the background designate the 
teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and 
wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, 
as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The 
three symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also 
represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield 
bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of 
Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas 
Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become "the people's 
university" for South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, 
orange, white and gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, 
are the official colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-
1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington 
(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the 
founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his 
leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a 
national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of 
American Foresters, American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also 
heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the 
State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
