HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
R. ROY PEARCE 
Clemson alumnus R. Roy Pearce of Columbia has long been a national 
figure in the multi-billion dollar food service industry. He also is known as one of 
the University's most active and involved alumni who for decades has worked 
to strengthen the University's academic excellence. 
Mr. Pearce was born and raised at Columbia where he graduated from 
Columbia High School in 1937. He graduated from Clemson in 1941 and joined 
the Pearce-Young-Angel food distribution company, which his grandfather established in 1903. Eight months later he was on active duty with the Air Force and 
headed overseas for the next three years. He served in every major European 
action from North Africa to Germany, including the beachhead victories at Anzio, 
Salerno and Gila, Sicily, and Omaha Beach at Normandy, France. He was the 
recipient of four Arrowhead decorations for invasions, the Bronze Star with Oakleaf Cluster, and his unit received the French Croix de Guerre. 
Returning to PYA Company in 1945, he was elected vice president, and 
president and chief executive officer in 1960. When PYA merged into Consolidated Foods Corp. (now Sara Lee Corp.} in 1967, he served as PYA president 
and was elected group vice president of Consolidated Foods in 1970. 
In 1971 he was elected chairman and chief executive officer of Monarch 
Institutional Foods, a division of Consolidated Foods. The Monarch operation was 
moved from Chicago in 1972 and made a part of the PYA Company. Mr. Pearce 
was elected to the Board of Directors of Consolidated Foods Corp. in 1972 and 
was chief executive officer and chairman of PYA/Monarch, Inc. He helped to 
establish the firm as a national food service distributor whose sales went from 
$35 million annually to more than $1 billion a year, making it one of South Carolina's largest companies. Mr. Pearce is a director and a member of the executive 
committee of SCN Corp. and serves as a director of Sonoco Products Co. 
Roy Pearce left the Clemson campus as a graduate forty-five years ago, but 
his heart has never left this special place. He has continued to work for and 
serve Clemson through the years, including two terms as National President of 
the Clemson Alumni Association, 15 years on the Clemson Foundation Board, 
past President of the Columbia Clemson Club, and chairman of the Finance 
Committee for the Building Fund of the Alumni Center dedicated in 1973. 
His current Clemson project finds him - as class president - at the helm 
of a $1 million academic fund-raising campaign for the Class of 1941 - the 
class that marched out of college and off to war. About one-fourth of the 409 
graduates of the class lost their lives while serving their country in World War II, 
and contributions will be used to establish The Class of '41 Memorial Endowment 
to honor both them and other classmates who have died since then. 
The Endowment will provide scholarships and support a professorship in the 
College of Liberal Arts. The class plans to commemorate Its Golden Anniversary 
Reunion in 1991 by presenting the memorial endowment as a gift to Clemson. 
Roy Pearce has brought honor and distinction to Clemson in so many ways. 
Now it is our turn to honor one of our own with this honorary degree. We are 
fortunate that he chose Clemson many years ago, but we are exceptionally 
fortunate that he has remained committed and dedicated to her continued academic excellence and advancement in educational quality.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
FRANK H. WARDLAW 
South Carolinian Frank H. Wardlaw has enriched the life of academic communities in his native state and in Texas as a pioneer in establishing university 
presses. Hundreds and hundreds of books published under his direction are part 
of his legacy to scholars and the general public alike. 
Mr. Wardlaw was born at Indiantown in Williamsburg County in 1913 and 
pursued a career as a journalist at the University of South Carolina, where he 
majored in journalism and was managing editor of the student newspaper, The 
Gamecock. 
Between 1933 and 1937 he was a reporter for the Columbia Record and for 
the Associated Press. The following year he joined the faculty of the USC School 
of Journalism and was named director of the University News Service. 
His long association with the development of university presses began in 
1945 when he participated in the establishment of the University of South Carolina 
Press and became its first director. 
In 1950 Mr. Wardlaw left South Carolina and went to Austin, Texas, where 
his assignment was to organize the University of Texas Press. He served as its 
director until 1974 when he was lured to College Station to establish the Texas 
A&M University Press for UT's arch rival. 
Under Mr. Wardlaw's direction, nearly 800 books were published at the 
University of South Carolina and at the University of Texas, and approximately 
80 during his tenure at Texas A&M. 
On March 29, 1985, the State of Texas honored the South Carolinian who 
became the father of highly successful university presses at UT and A&M. The 
governor proclaimed Frank Wardlaw Day and The Dallas Morning News headlined the story, Texas honors the man who got the presses rolling. 
Mr. Wardlaw edited one book, Men and Women of Carolina, and is the author 
of I Have That Honor. Numerous magazine and newspaper articles include three 
in the Saturday Review and one in Harper's Magazine. 
Mr. Wardlaw served two terms as president of the Association of American 
University Presses and two terms as president of the Texas Institute of Letters. 
He was instrumental in the development of AAUP's Latin American translation 
program and in establishing the Inter-American Scholarly Book Center (GILA) 
in Mexico City, serving on the GILA Board of Directors for five years. 
He was a member of the Advisory Publications Committee of John Knox 
Press for nine years and on the Advisory Committee to the Wintertuhr Museum 
for three years. He also has been a member of the Board of Directors of Franklin 
Book programs and of the Advisory Committee on Humanities Publications of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities. 
Mr. Wardlaw left Texas A&M in 1978 and returned to South Carolina to live 
in retirement on Fripp Island. 
Clemson University holds him and his achievements in the highest regard. 
It is a special privilege for all of us to honor him in this way.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
