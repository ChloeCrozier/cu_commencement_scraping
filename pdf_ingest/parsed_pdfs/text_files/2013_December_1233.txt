HONORARY DEGREE 
James E Rogers, Jr. 
Doctorate of Humanities 
James "Jim" E Rogers, Jr. is a business leader of worldwide reputation 
and influence. His foresight and business acumen led to the creation 
of Duke Energy, the nation's largest electric utility, where he has 
served as chairman, president, CEO and is currently chairman of the 
board. 
Even before his tenure with Duke Energy, Rogers took a very 
progressive outlook in the energy sector, advocating investing 
in energy efficiency, modernizing the electric infrastructure and 
pursuing advanced technologies and nuclear energy to grow the 
economy and transition to a low-carbon future. He serves as vice 
chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and was honored by the 
Alliance to Save Energy with its Lifetime Achievement Award. During his tenure as CEO, Duke 
Energy was recognized as a leader in sustainability, balancing the "triple bottom line" - people, 
planet and profits. The company was twice named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 
and part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America. 
Jim Rogers served as deputy general counsel for litigation and enforcement for the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission and as an expert commentator in media as diverse as "60 
Minutes," The New York Times Magazine, CNBC and "The Colbert Report." He has also 
testified more than 20 times before U.S. Congressional committees and international forums 
including the United Nations General Assembly, the World Economic Forum and the Clinton 
Global Initiative. 
Jim Roger's focus on innovation, creativity and sustainability is perfectly aligned with 
Clemson's commitment to environmental, economic and social stewardship. Under the 
leadership of Jim Rogers, Duke Energy has been a valuable partner with the University both 
on campus and at the Clemson University Restoration Institute in North Charleston. At this 
interdisciplinary facility, Clemson University engineers and scientists will collaborate with other 
agencies and private industry to test next-generation energy systems. The overarching goal is to 
accelerate innovations to market and lower the cost of meeting the nation's energy needs. 
Born in 1947 in Birmingham, Ala., Jim Rogers earned Bachelor of Business Administration 
and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Kentucky. He and his wife Mary Anne have 
three children and 11 grandchildren. 
Jim Rogers is an astute attorney, innovative businessman, global leader, community partner 
and outspoken advocate for responsible, sustainable energy development. In recognition of 
his numerous achievements and his valuable partnership with Clemson University, it is a great 
honor to bestow the honorary degree, Doctorate of Humanities, on James E Rogers, Jr.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson' mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors represented by insets of carneli an (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the governing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college mar hals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university eal 
and the ymbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr. CC Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
(1807-1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina fo r the found ing of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a 
scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during the 
first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort 
Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced 
only two four-year curricu la, supplemented by two two-year 
preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 fo r questions 
about the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by MCSB International (Association 
to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council 
for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association 
(CADE), American Society of Landscape Architects, Commission 
on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs 
(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPN MLR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available 
in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not 
only in its primary academic program, but does extensive research 
at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment stations 
located in the state. The University is also heavily committed 
to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricu ltural extension, which has professional personnel located 
in each of the state's counties. l
