Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), 
who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that 
of a mining engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a Southern Planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge 
d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852), and served as the first superintendent of 
agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published 
numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, and agriculture. His 
varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland 
Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in the founding of Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. 
Calhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half of 
the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on 
the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has nine major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences; the College of Architecture; the College 
of Education; the College of Engineering; the College of Industrial Management and Textile Science; the College of Liberal Arts; the School of 
Nursing; the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences; and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Engineers' 
Council for Professional Development, the American Chemical Society, the 
National Architectural Accrediting Board, and the Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a Land-Grant Institution. As such, it is engaged not only in 
its primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main 
campus and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the state. 
The University is also heavily committed to a varied program of public 
service, including the work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the state's counties.
