HONORARY DEGREE 
RANDOLPH RELIHAN SMITH 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Determination, dedication and diversity are the hallmarks of the life and career of 
Clemson alumnus and plastic and reconstructive surgeon Randolph R. Smith. 
Upon graduation from Richmond Academy in his hometown of Augusta, Georgia, 
Randy came to Clemson in 1962 on a football scholarship under Coach Frank Howard. An 
outstanding center, Randy was drafted by the New York Jets of the American Football 
League and the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League. In his determination to 
study medicine, he passed up his final year of college eligibility and an opportunity to play 
professional football. A medical degree was this student-athlete's prime objective, and he 
credits his parents, Maxine and Lester Smith, with imbuing him with the proper respect for 
academics as we ll as athletics. 
Graduating from Clemson in 1966 with a Bachelor of Science degree in pre-medicine, 
Randy Smith headed back home for the Medical College of Georgia where he received his 
Doctor of Medicine degree in 1970. While serving as a major in the United States Army 
Reserve Medical Corps (1971-1978), he spent a year's internship in Internal Medicine at 
the Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University and four years as a 
resident in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Duke University. Dr. Smith 
returned to the Medical College of Georgia for his plastic surgery training in I 975, 
followed by a Christine Kleinert Fellowship in Hand Surgery at the University of 
Louisville (Kentucky). He established a private practice in Augusta in 1978. 
Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of 
Otolaryngology, Dr. Smith is an assistant clinical professor of plastic surgery at the 
Medical College of Georgia. A fellow of the American College of Surgeons and the 
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, he is also a member of 
the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the American Society of 
Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the Southeastern Society of Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgeons, and ocher national and regional medical societies including the American 
Medical Association. 
During his career at University Hospital in Augusta, which has been in continuous 
operation since 1818, Dr. Smith has chaired numerous committees and was appointed to 
the Richmond County Hospital Authority and the University Hospital governing board. 
He has also served as president of the medical staff at the historic institution. 
Dedicated to using his talents and skills to help the less fortunate, Dr. Smith has served 
as a volunteer surgeon and lecturer in plastic and hand surgery in remote and 
underdeveloped areas of the world. Since 1982, he has carried out missions of mercy in 
japan, Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Venezuela, El 
Salvador, South Korea and Poland. He concentrates his work on the treatment of 
congenital defects, cancer and mutilation caused by civil war, as well as the restoration of 
form and function of injured human limbs. 
His interest in his own community has led him into paths of diversity beyond his busy 
medical career. Since his younger days as an acolyte, he has been an active member of St. 
Paul's Episcopal Church where he serves on the senior vestry. He is a longtime member 
and director of the Exchange Club of Augusta, which annually raises tens of thousands of 
dollars for Augusta's needy. Dr. Smith is a founding director and executive committee 
member of the Georgia Bank and Trust Company, a leading financial institution in the 
Augusta area. 
This surgeon's eminent achievements and meritorious conrriburions have earned him 
recognition in Who's Who in America and Who's Who in Medicine and Health Care. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes one of its own 
sons with the presentation of an honorary doctorate. We hold Dr. Randolph R. Smith and 
his achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the 
presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

HONORARY DEGREE 
CYRIL THOMAS WYCHE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Clemson University Founder Thomas Green Clemson would have been honored to 
share the stage with Greenville attorney and environmenta list C. Thomas Wyche. A 
creative and innovative thinker, a visionary with strong leadership qualities and 
impeccable integrity, a humanitarian-Mr. Wyche, like Mr. Clemson, is a true 
Renaissance man. 
In the early 1970s, South Carolina faced an environmenta l tragedy as unchecked 
development threatened a Blue Ridge Mountain wilderness. Mr. Wyche envisioned a 
disturbing future for some of South Carolina's most spectacular scenery, and with the help 
of other environmenta lists, he headed it off. In 1973, he organized Naturaland Trust, the 
state's first conservation land trust, which ultimately would preserve a 40,000-acre 
wilderness area spanning the Blue Ridge Mountains of northern Greenville County now 
known as the Mountain Bridge Wilderness Area. Part of South Carolina's Blue Ridge 
Escarpment, the area is located between two Greenville County watersheds, Table Rock 
and Poinsett. 
For the next 20 years, the Mountain Bridge project was, in essence, the story of a series 
of cooperative partnerships created and susta ined by Mr. Wyche-partnerships with 
individual landowners, local, state and federal government agencies, and private industry 
co acquire the land and assist in its conservation and management. Without Mr. Wyche's 
keen insight, appreciation for the environment and furious determination, a part of South 
Carolina's heritage would have been forever and irretrievably lost. 
Mr. Wyche was recognized for his diligent conservation efforts last year by Governor 
David Beasley, who presented him with the Order of the Palmetto, the highest award for 
public service given by the state of South Carolina. Also in 1996, Mr. Wyche was the 
single national recipient of the Alexander Calder Conservation Award. The South 
Carolina Wildlife Federation Environmentalist of the Year in 1979, he was one of ten 
national recipients of the Gulf O il National Conservation Award in 1983 and one of four 
national recipients of the Nature Conservancy Oak Leaf Award in 1995. 
Mr. Wyche's passion for the wilderness is captured by his photography and text in South 
Carolina's Mountain Wilderness: The Blue Ridge Escarpment, a coffee-table book published by 
Westcliffe Publishers in 1994. A more recent book of photographs by Tommy Wyche, The 
Blue Wall, Wilderness of the Carolinas and Georgia, is the springboard for his current major 
conservation project, the preservation of 50,000 acres of the mountain gorges surrounding 
Lake Jocassee. This area, together with the contiguous Mountain Bridge Wilderness, is 
described as "the most significant wilderness remaining in South Carolina." 
The Greenville native's commitment to community service has led him to serve on the 
boards of Citizens and Southern Corporation, the Greater Greenville Chamber of 
Commerce, the United Way of Greenville County and the Greenville County 
Foundation. He also has been active in the leadership of the YMCA, the Greenville Little 
Theater, the Greenville Arts Festival Association, the Greenville Symphony Association 
and the Greenville Country Club. 
Tommy Wyche graduated from Yale University in 1946 with a degree in electrical 
engineering and earned his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1949. Since that 
time, he has been in the private practice of law with the firm of Wyche, Burgess, Freeman 
and Parham, P.A., concentrating in corporate, securities, tax, and merger and acquisition 
law. The senior parrner is a member of the Greenville County Bar Association, the S.C. 
Bar Association, the American Bar Association and the American Judicature Society. 
We hold Thomas Wyche and his lifetime achievements in the highest esteem. It is a 
distinct privilege to honor him for his foresight and dedication to the heritage of South 
Carolina with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the banner bearers are the college marshals and faculty. Each banner is a 
combination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which 
were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College

Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-185 2) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on 
Accreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of 
Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
