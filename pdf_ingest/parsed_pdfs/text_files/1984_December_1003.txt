HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
JAMESLARNARDFERGUSON 
James Lamard Ferguson has distinguished himself through outstanding 
leadership of one of the nation's most respected corporations and in an active 
role of promoting greater private support for higher education. 
Mr. Ferguson is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of 
General Foods Corporation, the world's largest United States-based company 
operating solely in the food area. It is an $8-billion-plus multinational corporation, 
employing 56,000 people and producing some 1,200 food products. 
His corporate management role has given him an excellent opportunity to 
rally America's corporate community on behalf of higher education's financial 
needs. He is well-known as a strong supporter of the mission of our academic 
institutions and what they mean to the prosperity of the nation. 
During his tenure as chairman of the Council for Financial Aid to Education, 
which encourages and monitors private support for higher education, he worked 
to increase public awareness of corporate support to higher education with an 
optimistic message about its future. The Council has been highly successful in 
helping to raise the level of corporate support of higher education. 
He called on his colleagues in the corporate world to review their corporate 
contributions programs to be sure they were doing as much as they reasonably 
could. He has said that what business and industry do for colleges and universities, they do ultimately for all the people. 
And he has underscored how vitally important it is for corporations to help 
academic institutions maintain excellence in undergraduate and graduate instruction and in the basic research that undergirds so much of our technological 
progress. 
Mr. Ferguson has been with General Foods Corporation for 21 years. He was 
born in Evanston, Illinois, and is a graduate of Hamilton College, where he is a 
Trustee, and the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration. 
He serves on the Board of Managers of The New York Botanical Garden and is 
a member of the Board of Governors and chairman of the National Financial 
Development Committee of the American Red Cross. He is married to Esther 
Baskin Ferguson of Summerton, South Carolina, a leader in her own right in the 
field of private and voluntary support. 
It is a special privilege to honor this good friend of higher education and of 
Clemson University, and to express our most sincere appreciation for all that he 
has meant to higher education's well-being and continued advancement. 
Clemson is proud to present the honorary Doctor of Laws degree to James L. 
Ferguson.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
WILLIAM HENRY KINARD 
William Henry Kinard is a South Carolinian and Clemson alumnus who is 
helping to keep America number one in space research and exploration. 
He joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1955, the 
year following his graduation from Clemson with a Bachelor of Mechanical 
Engineering degree. 
Today at the Langley Research Center at Hampton, Virginia, he is NASA's 
chief scientist for a research project he conceived and developed to study the 
effects of exposure in the environment of space. 
The product of Bill Kinard's idea is a 12-sided, 11-ton rack which is now 
circling the Earth and carrying the experiments of 200 investigators. The experiment, known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility, was placed into orbit by a 
space shuttle flight last April 6th. It will be retrieved by another shuttle crew 
next February, and the many investigators will be able to do the analyses of their 
experiments in their own laboratories. 
His leadership In the development of many other significant space experiments is well-known, particularly with regard to his work on the Meteoroid Detector Experiment for Pioneer 10 and 11, and Pegasus and the Meteoroid Technology Satellite. 
He is recipient of the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement 
for the Pioneer Ten Mission to Jupiter; the NASA Public Service Award for the 
same mission the Langley Research Center Special Achievement Award for his 
studies of meteoroid penetration measurements during interplanetary space 
flight; the NASA Achievement Award for his work in the Pegasus program; and 
the NASA Achievement Award in the Apollo program. 
Mr. Kinard Is the author or coauthor of 36 scientific papers and holds five 
patents for research instruments. His 1975 paper entitled, "Interplanetary and 
Near-Jupiter Meteoroid Environments," was chosen as the Outstanding Publication of the Space Directorate. 
Bill Kinard has used his Clemson education to advance mankind's knowledge 
of his planet and the worlds beyond, and in so doing, has brought great credit to 
both himself and to this institution which proudly honors him today. 
Bill Kinard the space scientist is well-known among his colleagues, but 
there is another side which he also enjoys that probably brings him as much 
personal satisfaction as his professional achievements. He is concerned about 
people in need, especially troubled youth, and has reached out to help and encourage them. Bill and his wife, Becky, have opened their home and their hearts 
to the young people of the Williamsburg, Virginia, area who have alcohol and 
drug problems. They have given countless hours In their home to counseling 
youth about their problems. 
It Is a special privilege for all of us at Clemson to honor him with the 
presentation of an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree in recognition of his distinguished scientific achievement and his sincere concern for the welfare of his 
fellowman.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale, 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
