HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
JAMES RUTHERFORD FAIR, JR. 
Dr. James R. Fair, Jr., educator, engineer, author and historian has received 
world-wide recognition for his contributions to the development of separations 
technology, which is fundamental to the chemical industry and one of the 
cornerstones of the chemical engineering profession. 
Although born in Charleston, Missouri, Dr. Fair has family roots in upstate 
South Carolina. His father was born and reared in Newberry, and Dr. Fair lived 
there as a youngster in the late 1920s. 
Dr. Fair attended The Citadel before transferring to Georgia Tech to earn a 
Bachelor of Science Degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master's from 
the University of Michigan and a doctorate from the University of Texas, also in 
chemical engineering. 
He joined the Monsanto Chemical Company in 1943, achieving notable 
success in the company and eminence in his profession. He rose to Director of 
Technology with Monsanto before taking his talents to academia in 1979 when 
he joined the University of Texas. 
Dr. Fair has received numerous major awards for excellence in professional 
practice from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. He is a member of 
the National Academy of Engineering, and of several professional and honorary 
organizations. A prolific contributor to the chemical engineering literature with 
more than 100 technical publications, mostly in the area of separation processes, 
he still remains vigorously active in research. 
He is holder of the John J. McKetta Centennial Energy Chair in Engineering 
of the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. 
He is head of the University's Separations Research Program, a consortium of 
37 industries who sponsor research in separations technology. Started by Dr. 
Fair four years ago, the program is the largest of its kind in the world. 
A popular professor who loves to teach, Dr. Fair has won many teaching 
awards. He is a sought-after lecturer and consultant who travels all over the 
world to share his knowledge and expertise. His continuing education course on 
separations technology has been given more often than any other American 
Institute of Chemical Engineers' course. 
Dr. Fair has served on numerous university advisory boards (including that 
of the Clemson's Chemical Engineering Department), and on editorial advisory 
boards for several professional journals. He has an honorary doctorate from 
Washington University in St. Louis. 
Complementing his professional career is a lifelong interest in trains and 
railroading that dates back to his childhood days in Newberry. His great-grandfather, Simeon Fair, was a prominent railroad builder in the Newberry area. 
Dr. Fair has written one book and several articles on railroading. He has done 
research on South Carolina railroads and prepared a history of one that runs 
even today from Columbia to Laurens operating under Seaboard CSX Weston 
System. 
Through his technical expertise and leadership in his profession, Dr. Fair 
has contributed greatly to a better quality of life throughout the world. Clemson 
University is honored to award this honorary doctoral degree to Dr. James R. 
Fair, Jr., in recognition of his distinguished achievements.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
LEE MULLER THOMAS 
Lee Thomas, dedicated and outstanding public servant, distinguished American and South Carolinian, is administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
Mr. Thomas has served as the chief protector of our nation's environment 
and public health since 1985 when he was appointed to head the agency by 
President Ronald Reagan. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. 
Mr. Thomas is the President's principal adviser on environmental matters 
and serves as the Administration's chief spokesman in this area. The agency is 
responsible for administering and enforcing 13 federal statutes dealing with 
environmental protection, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and 
laws concerning toxic waste, and toxic chemicals and pesticides. He directs a 
research and development program for environmental improvement and spearheads international efforts aimed at solving global environmental problems. 
As EPA chief, Mr. Thomas oversees a program with 14,000 employees and 
an annual budget of more than $5 billion. The agency has 10 regional offices and 
31 laboratories. 
A great tribute to his leadership, knowledge and commitment to a cleaner 
and safer America was the passage of the landmark Superfund legislation last 
year to support a toxic waste cleanup program five times the size of the previous 
effort. Mr. Thomas played the pivotal role in the passage of this law, which was 
a major step not only toward saving and restoring the country's precious natural 
resources but also in protecting the health and very lives of its citizens. 
His philosophy and management style have enabled him to effectively carry 
out his duties and have earned him the respect of both environmental groups 
and the nation's business community. 
Mr. Thomas, who is from Ridgeway in Fairfield County, studied engineering 
at Clemson in the sixties, earned a bachelor's degree in psychology at the 
University of the South at Sewanee, Tenn., and began working as a juvenile 
probation officer. He later earned a master's degree in counseling at the University of South Carolina. · 
His federal career of public service began in 1981 when he was called to 
Washington by President Reagan to serve as associate director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and went on to become its executive deputy 
director. His move to the national scene followed an exceptional period of state 
public service in South Carolina which included five years as executive director 
of the Office of Criminal Justice Program, Office of the Governor, and then 
several years as director of the Division of Public Safety Programs, Office of 
the Governor. 
For the past 20 years Lee Thomas has held positions of public trust, each 
of which has carried a larger challenge and required a greater commitment. 
Each time he has responded in a manner which has made him a model for 
public servants functioning in the complex social, political and technical environment of this age. It has been said that his vision, leadership and professionalism will have a major positive impact on the quality of our environment for 
generations to come. 
Clemson University holds him and his achievements in the highest regard. 
It is a privilege for all of us to honor not only a good Clemson friend, but a man 
who has contributed so much of himself to improving the quality of life of his 
fellow man.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth / 
Ever in our lives.
