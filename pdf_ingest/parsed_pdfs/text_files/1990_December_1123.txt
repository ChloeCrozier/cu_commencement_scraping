HONORARY DEGREE 
BONNIE J. DUNBAR 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Astronaut Bonnie Dunbar has flown missions in both the Challenger and Columbia 
space shuttles since becoming an astronaut with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration in 1981. 
A native of Sunnyside, Washington, Dr. Dunbar earned her S.S. and M.S. degrees 
in ceramic engineering at the University of Washington and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering at the University of Houston (1983). Her multidisciplinary dissertation (materials science and physiology) involved an evaluation of the effects of 
simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness using an animal model. 
She currently is an adjunct professor in mechanical engineering at the University of 
Houston and serves on the Bioengineering Advisory Group. 
Prior to joining NASA Dr. Dunbar held a senior research engineer position with 
• Rockwell International Space Division in Downey, California. Her responsibilities included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the space shuttle 
thermal protection system. 
In 1978 she accepted a position as a payload officer/flight controller at NASA's 
Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. She served as a guidance and naviga-
.. lion officer/flight controller for the Skylab reentry mission in 1979 and was subsequently designated project officer/payload officer for the integration of several space 
shuttle payloads. 
· Dr. Dunbar was a mission specialist on the crew of STS 61-A, the West German 
D-1 Spacelab mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 30, 
1985. This seven-day mission was the first to carry eight crewmembers, the largest to 
fly in space, and also was the first in which payload activities were controlled from 
outside the United States. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth in 169 hours, Challenger landed at Edwards Air Force Base on November 6, 1985. 
Dr. Dunbar next served as a mission specialist on the crew of STS-32 which 
launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 9, 1990. In the longest shuttle 
mission to date, crewmembers on board Columbia successfully deployed the Syncom 
IV-F5 satellite and retrieved the 21,400 lb. Long Duration Exposure Facility using the 
Remote Manipulator System. Following 173 orbits in 261 hours, Columbia returned 
with a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base on January 20, 1990. 
With the completion of her second shuttle flight, Dr. Dunbar had Jogged 430 hours 
in space. She enjoys flying and is a private pilot with more than 200 hours in single 
engine land aircraft and has logged more than 500 hours flying time in T-38 jets as 
co-pilot. 
Clemson University holds Dr. Bonnie Dunbar and her achievements in the highest 
regard, and it is a special privilege to honor her with the awarding of this honorary 
degree.

HONORARY DEGREE 
JOHN ANDREW McALLISTER 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
South Carolinian John McAllister, businessman, public servant, award-winning 
conservationist, and champion of economic development in rural South Carolina, is 
one of the Palmetto State's outstanding citizens and most ardent promoters. 
Mr. McAllister is counted among that small number of people who have the vision 
to recognize what can be accomplished, the industriousness to undertake the plain 
hard work involved with any progress, and the persistence to see the job through. A 
critical element of his success is the fact that he is a man of great integrity who 
subordinates his own interests for the benefit of his community, his religion, and his 
state. His membership and leadership in all of his various interests are not for personal 
gain, but rather, his personal effort to make sure he leaves the world a better place 
than he found it. 
Jn 1986 Governor Richard W. Riley presented Mr. McAllister with the Order of the 
Palmetto, the highest honor given to a resident, acknowledging his longtime public 
service to a variety of business, conservation education, and welfare organizations. 
Other past and current service, accomplishmen:s and honors worthy of note include: 
Chairman of the state agency, Savannah Valley Authority, and the primary force 
behind the development of the 4,000-acre Savannah Lakes Village Retirement Community; Co-founder and president of the West Carolina Rural Telephone Cooperative; 
U.S. Department of Agriculture National Rural Telephone Bank Board, Washington, 
DC, with 18 years continuous service; Member and officer, Clemson Board of Visitors; 
Clemson Alumni National Council and State-wide Support Group; Member, past chairman, Board of Directors, Upper Savannah Council of Governments continuously since 
1978; Past Chairman, member of Board of Trustees, John de la Howe School, McCormick County; twice honored for contributions to wildlife conservation by S. C. 
Wildlife Federation. 
Also, Past President, S. C. Forestry Association and "Tree Farmer of the Year"; 
S. C. Soil Conservation Districts' "Sate Conservationist of the Year"; S. C. Economic 
Development Association's Lifetime Service Award; Old Ninety Six Tourism Commission's "Person-of-the-Year" Award; testified before U.S. Senate subcommittee on 
appropriations in support of economic development programs in rural America on 
behalf of the National Association of Development Organizations; Boy Scouts of 
America Silver Beaver Award. 
Good business judgment and keen foresight have made Mr. McAllister successful 
in furniture merchandising, cattle raising, timber growing, and land developing. Mr. 
McAllister is married to the former Catherine Harter of Ninety Six and has five 
children: John, Jr., Ed, Cathy, Wes, and Mary. 
John McAllister, through his business achievements, his personal conduct, and 
his years of unselfish public service, has helped improve the lives of countless South 
Carolinians. He is a worthy recipient of an honorary degree from his alma mater, and it 
is appropriate that Clemson University should recognize his service to the state and 
his commitment to others by awarding him the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

s Award 
KATHRYN CRAVEN LEMON LOIS WALTERS COKER 
KATHRYN CRAVEN LEMON 
For Kathryn Craven Lemon, service to community and education has always been 
a family affair. In her hometown of Bennettsville, her grandmother's family founded 
Fletcher Memorial High School, still in operation today. 
With plans to become a teacher, Kathryn studied at the University of South 
Carolina,. where she graduated cum laude in 1934 and met her future husband, 
Calhoun Lemon of Barnwell, a former Clemson student. The Lemons participated in 
many cultural, service and church-related projects. Kathryn helped start a Girl Scout 
troop, served as PTA president, and has worked on city beautification and anti-litter 
projects. Both Lemons were instrumental in founding the Barnwell County Museum. 
Kathryn chaired its board for eight years and still holds an administrative seat. The 
Lemons served in a variety of offices in the Barnwell United Methodist Church, where 
Kathryn oversaw the research and writing of the church's history for its centennial 
celebration. 
Clemson University has been a main beneficiary of the Lemons' generosity and 
foresight. In 1972, they endowed the William James Lemon Professorship in Literature; 
in 1984, the Kathryn and Calhoun Lemon Professorship in History Annual Supplement; 
and in 1986, the Kathryn and Calhoun Lemon Philosophy Professorship. 
Since Calhoun's death in 1989, Kathryn has continued the family legacy of 
concern for her community and for Clemson. With gratitude and admiration, Clemson 
University is honored to have her accept The President's Award. 
LOIS WALTERS COKER 
Lois Walters Coker's commitment to education has its roots in her native Idaho. 
Its results are manifest in her adopted South Carolina. 
Following the advice of her father - an attorney who served in Franklin Roosevelt's administration and a firm believer in education for women - she pursued 
higher education for herself. After earning a bachelor's degree at the University of 
Idaho and a master's at the University of California at Berkeley, she began a career of 
helping others become educated. In Idaho, she taught for two years in one-room rural 
schools. When marriage to Robert Richardson Coker brought her to the Palmetto 
State, she joined him in a lifelong partnarship that has significantly advanced educational opportunities for many South Carolinians. 
Her late husband, a University of South Carolina graduate, was a leading agriculturalist who headed Coker's Pedigreed Seed Co. He was a Clemson Life Trustee from 
1960 to 1987, the year he died. The Cokers that year made a personal commitment of 
$500,000 toward the Robert and Lois Coker Chair in Molecular Genetics at Clemson. 
The endowment has now reached $1 million, and a search is under way to fill the chair. 
Through the S. C. Farm Bureau, the Cokers also established a graduate fellowship 
in agriculture at Clemson, and the entire Coker family has been generous in its support 
of Coker College for generations. 
Because of all Lois Coker has done to improve South Carolina's educational 
potential, Clemson University proudly presents to her The President's Award.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread ; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a " V" ). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institutio.n. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical State1nent 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
