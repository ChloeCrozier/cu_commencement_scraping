HONORARY DEGREE 
LARRY A. JACKSON 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Dr. Larry Jackson, the architect of Lander Colleqe's remarkable rebirth and 
revitalization since 1973, is one of South Carolina's outstandinq leaders in hiqher 
education. 
Dr. Jackson has served as President of Lander Colleqe for the past eiqhteen 
years, and as such, ranks as one of the lonqest-servinq presidents of any fouryear state college or university in South Carol ina. He has quided Lander's transformation from a small private institution to a vital state-supported colleqe. 
He was Vice President for Administration at the University of Evansville, 
Indiana, when he accepted the Lander presidency in 1973. 
Arriving in Greenwood, he found an academic institution that had been on 
the decline for sometime. Buildings were old and the student body numbered only 
about 900. But under his leadership, a steady and deliberate metamorphosis 
began to take place, and a new Lander College emerqed. 
Today Lander is moving toward the twenty-first century with an almost 
brand-new campus and more than 2,600 students, thanks to Dr. Jackson's 
guidance. 
"To literally have built a campus in eiqhteen years is extraordinary," said a 
colleague. 
Dr. Jackson is a native South Carolinian who was born in Florence. He was 
educated at Wofford College, Union Theoloqical Seminary in New York, where he 
earned a Master of Divinity degree, and at the University of the Pac ific, where he 
received an M.A. degree. Also, he has honorary doctoral deqrees from several 
colleges and universities. 
His academic career also includes positions at Callison Colleqe of the University of the Pacific, where he served as Provost, and Director of Santiaqo 
College in Santiago, Chile, for several years. Dr. Jackson also served for six 
years as a minister, including two years as minister of the American Church in 
Santiago, Chile. 
During his outstanding tenure at Lander, private support of the Colleqe 
through the Lander Foundation has grown from $250,000 to $4 mill ion. The 
number of faculty members has increased from 40 to 135 and a number of 
academic majors have been added, includinq a master's in elementary education. 
He has announced his plans to retire next June to pursue other interests 
such as writing, studying, and perhaps politics. 
Dr. Larry Jackson is a gentleman and a scholar, and his contributions to 
higher education are many. It is a privilege for Clemson University to honor him 
at the culmination of a distinguished career at Lander Colleqe and to thank him 
for all that he has done for hiqher education in the State of South Carol ina.

Tbe President's Award 
WILLIAM EDWARD GRISHAW, JR. HULDAH CAIL MINGLEDORFF 
WILLIAM EDWARD GRISHAW, JR. 
Laughter, love, respect and friendship. These are the qifts that William Edward 
Grishaw, Jr. has given to thousands of special South Carolinians. For more than two 
decades he has been chairman, fund-raiser, reqistrar, and chief advocate for Camp 
Sertoma at the Clemson University Outdoor Laboratory. 
Camp Sertoma, which principally serves children with speech and hearinq impairments, was one of the earliest of the Outdoor Laboratory's now numerous proqrams 
for special campers. Bill Grishaw was there at the beqinninq, and he remains a 
steadfast and effective volunteer leader for Camp Sertoma and for the continuing 
enhancement and development of the Outdoor Laboratory. Larqely because of his 
leadership, the Outdoor Laboratory has received more than $300,000 in new facilities 
and improvements and $700,000 in sponsorships for campers. Not a sinqle child has 
ever been charged to attend Camp Sertoma. 
Mr. Grishaw serves Clemson in other ways as well. Both a Clemson qraduate 
(1961) and a resident of the Clemson community, he helped establish in 1985 the 
Joint City/University Committee, which promotes cooperation and coordination between the City and the University on matters of mutual interest. He is also involved in 
numerous other civic and community activities. 
Because of his contributions to youth, his alma mater and his community, 
Clemson University proudly presents The President's Award to William Edward 
Grishaw, Jr. 
HULDAH CAIL MINGLEDORFF 
Agriculture, history and education are principal interests of Huldah Cail Minqledorff. This is reflected by her stewardship of Millhaven Plantation, the larqest familyowned working farm east of the Mississippi River. Millhaven was founded in 1788 in 
southeastern Georgia on lands once occupied by the Euchee Indians. Today, the 
plantation's 24,000 acres are devoted to crops, timber, livestock and wildlife. 
Mrs. Mingledorff's commitment to maintaininq Millhaven's rich heritaqe and aqricultural productivity is joined by her desire to discover opportunities for this valuable 
natural resource to benefit higher education. Accordinqly, she has established the 
Lorimer Millhaven Foundation to conduct and support aqricultural, environmental and 
other educational programs in conjunction with public universities. Clemson University 
is honored to be represented on the Board of Directors of the Lorimer Millhaven 
Foundation. 
Clemson appreciates the many advantages that this association will provide for 
future generations of our faculty and students. We thank Mrs. Minqledorff for makinq 
this possible, and we look forward to her continuinq friendship. In recoqn ition thereof, 
Clemson is pleased to bestow upon Huldah Cail Minqledorff The President's Award.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture 
Architecture 
Commerce & Industry 
Education

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors. 

Page 24
Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools ; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
