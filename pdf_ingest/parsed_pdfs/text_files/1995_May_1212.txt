HONORARY DEGREE 
PHILIP HUNTER PRINCE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Few names have been more closely associated with the history of Clemson University than that of Philip Prince. 
His presidency for the past year caps a lifetime of service to Clemson, highlighted 
by leadership positions as life trustee, Campaign for Clemson Chairman, Clemson 
University Foundation President, and others. 
He became president during a critical time in our history, with the University in 
the early stages of major restructuring, facing declining budgets and seeking a permanent president. In accepting, he set two conditions: that he forfeit his seat as a life 
trustee to avoid any conflict of interest and that he donate his salary to the Clemson 
University Foundation. 
President Prince has provided outstanding leadership to the University, including 
completing academic and administrative restructuring so that fewer resources are 
devoted to administration and more to teaching and student needs. He has improved 
communications with faculty and staff and has been a strong advocate for Clemson 
and for all of higher education in South Carolina. 
Mr. Prince served as chairman of the South Carolina Council of Presidents, and 
through editorials, appearances before legislative committees, television programs and 
speaking engagements throughout the state, sounded a consistent call for increased 
funding for higher education. 
A 1949 Clemson graduate, Phil Prince believes that a university's diploma carries 
with it the responsibility and commitment to give back something for the education 
received. His own service to Clemson reflects his conviction in this philosophy. 
He was recognized in 1989 for his corporate management expertise by his election as a Clemson life trustee. Last summer, he came "out of retirement" to accept 
the challenge of leading the University as acting president while a president was selected. On September 30, 1994 the Board removed the "acting" and named him the twelfth 
president of Clemson. 
A scholarship athlete and four-year football letterman, Mr. Prince was co-captain of the undefeated and untied 1948 Clemson Tiger football team which defeated the 
University of Missouri 24-23 in the 1949 Gator Bowl. In the 1948 Big Thursday game 
with South Carolina, he blocked a fourth-quarter punt which produced the winning 
touchdown for Clemson . The Tigers won 13-7. 
Since their marriage in 1950, his helpmate and strongest support has been Celeste 
Orr Prince of Rock Hill. He and Celeste have established a life scholarship for Clemson athletics. They also created the Celeste and Philip Prince Presidential Scholarship 
Endowment that will provide ten full scholarships for outstanding young people to 
attend Clemson. 
Clemson has honored him many times for his distinguished service and countless 
contributions to Clemson and the people of South Carolina. These include the Alumni 
Distinguished Service Award (1983); President's Award (1987); Clemson Medallion, the 
University's highest public honor (1989) ; and the Institutional Advancement Award 
(1992). 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors 
one of its own with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for meritorious contributions to the institution. We hold Phil Prince and his achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the presentation of the Doctor of 
Humanities.

Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, 
the coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this 
institution: teaching, research and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. 
The bottom contains a series of open books representing the 
concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The 
white of the books and the purple of the background designate the 
teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and 
wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, 
as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The 
three symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also 
represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield 
bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of 
Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas 
Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become "the people's 
university" for South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, 
orange, white and gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, 
are the official colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-
1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington 
(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the 
founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his 
leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a 
national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of 
American Foresters, American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also 
heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the 
State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
