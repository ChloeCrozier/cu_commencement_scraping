HONORARY DEGREE 
STANLEY H. SCHUMAN 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Dr. Stanley Schuman, the father of agricultural medicine in South Carolina, has been 
described by colleagues as a true renaissance man and a pioneer in agromedicine in the state. 
Recognized by medical and agricultural professionals as an international expert and 
leader in his field, Dr. Schuman is medical director of the agromedicine program of Clemson 
University and the Medical University of South Carolina. He also is Professor of Family Medicine 
and Pediatrics at the medical university. 
He is widely respected for his expertise in the health effects of agricultural chemicals 
and, as such, his contributions have led to greater public understanding of the scientific facts on 
issues involving the safety of agricultural products. 
Years ago Dr. Schuman realized the necessity for science and reason to triumph over 
misguided emotion and fear in confronting issues of disease, pesticides, and human health. 
Accordingly, he developed, founded, and currently sustains an agromedicine program which 
provides the maturity of judgment and scientific foundation necessary to address these problems. 
It is the first such state-funded, inter-university program of its kind in the nation, linking 
Dr. Jere Brittain of Clemson and Dr. Schuman as co-coordinators. Because of his pioneering work, 
Dr. Schuman was asked to appear before the Agriculture Committee of Congress to assist the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in developing agromedicine programs throughout the nation, linking 
land-grant and medical campuses in each state. 
Dr. Schuman has achieved high distinction in service to South Carolina's farm families, 
agricultural workers, employees in associated industries, and to the consumers of agricultural 
products. In addition to the medical consultations he provides to the state's citizens and their health 
care providers , he is a popular speaker on agricultural medicine to agricultural, medical, and public 
audiences across the state. 
In 1991 he established a network of volunteer advisory physicians in each county, an 
invaluable resource for extension, regulatory, and many others. He and his associates at the medical 
university and at Clemson have conducted an unprecedented educational campaign through county 
meetings, media presentations, workshops, and classes for medical students. The results are clearly 
improved confidence by consumers in the quality and safety of the food supply and heightened 
awareness by farmers and the agribusiness community for the concerns of consumers and the health 
and safety of farmers and farm workers. 
His efforts not only have enhanced agricultural productivity, but also the quality of life 
for all South Carolinians as well, and have contributed greatly to a better understanding within the 
medical community of some of the problems which can arise because of agricultural operations. 
He is founding editor of the international Journal of Agromedicine and has published 
more than 200 peer-reviewed articles in national and international journals. Most of his articles 
focus on the preventative aspects of environmental and occupational medicine. 
We hold Stanley Schuman and his lifetime achievements and service to all of the 
citizens of South Carolina in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the 
presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

HONORARY DEGREE 
PAULL. TOBEY 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Clemson alumnus and benefactor Paul Tobey enjoyed a successful and outstanding 
career as a corporate executive in the chemical industry. 
He was born in Hampton, New Hampshire, and earned his Bachelor of Science degree 
at Clemson in 1935, majoring in textile chemistry and dyeing. He first worked as a physical chemist 
with Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, before joining the Industrial Dyestuff 
Company, a business his father had established in East Providence, Rhode Island. 
During World War IJ at the siege of Myitkyina in Burma during the summer of 1944, 
Capt. Tobey was a liaison officer with a Chinese battalion. He directed a penetration through the 
Japanese lines. When discovered by the Japanese, the battalion set up a defense perimeter and, for 
three days, withstood Banzai attacks. The unit then was ordered to withdraw, since supporting units 
were unable to join them. The battalion made a successful night withdrawal. Capt. Tobey was 
decorated with the Bronze Star Medal. 
After the war, Mr. Tobey returned to Industrial Dyestuff as vice president and later was 
named president of the company, a position he held until retirement. He developed several chemical 
patents, replaced the manufacture of dyes with that of specialty chemicals, particularly for 
photographic processes, and he established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Nilok Chemical Company, 
in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr. Tobey is referenced in Patent Office and in Chemical Abstracts. 
While managing a developing business, he also was caring for a growing family. In 1939 
he had married Sarah Beaudrot of Greenwood, whom he had met during his Clemson days when 
she was a student at Lander College. They have four children. 
Friends know Paul Tobey as a modest man of high moral character and integrity who 
tends to give others credit for many of his accomplishments. He feels greatly indebted to Clemson, 
not only for the education he received, but for setting him on his life's path with a firm foundation 
of basic American values which were reinforced at Clemson. 
He exemplifies those qualities which Clemson holds dear -- integrity, intellect, 
leadership, personal achievement, and service to his country and its people. 
In 1985 during the golden anniversary reunion of his graduating class, he and his wife 
established the Tobey-Beaudrot Professorship in Chemistry. It was funded by investment income 
from his gift to the Clemson University Foundation and, eventually, from four unitrusts he set up 
through the Foundation to provide a salary supplement and research support for the professorship. 
This endowed professorship in chemistry made it possible for Clemson to attract and 
retain a world renowned scholar to the faculty and put Clemson high on the list of major programs 
in chemistry. Dr. Darryl D. DesMarteau was selected as the first recipient of the professorship. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of 
its own sons with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievement and 
meritorious contributions to the institution. We hold Paul Tobey and his achievements in the 
highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the presentation of the honorary 
degree, Doctor of Laws.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and 
honored guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is 
preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described 
under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a 
combination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These 
colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as 
follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts and 
Humanities 
Business and Public Affairs

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing 
academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from 
institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' 
institutions are specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council 
on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of 
Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or 
discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' 
gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that 
terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels 
and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with 
black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline 
color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the 
awarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with 
bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging 
the hood to form the throat over the gown . The most frequently seen is dark blue, 
which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the 
hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University 
hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently 
the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or 
military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the 
University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hnod and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty 
do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and 
guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of 
Clemson University and must be present at any convocation where the 
University, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any 
official convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, 
carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace 
rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the 
ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, 
thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle 
Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably 
going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, 
with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors 
represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in 
the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for 
the whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of 
silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office" which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the seal of the University 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert 
Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of 
the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the 
batons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the 
lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson 
University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-
1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the 
founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at 
the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was 
that of a mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his 
interests into politics and the life of a southern planter, and he soon 
became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and 
served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in 
Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the 
fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. 
Calhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half 
of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved 
on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two 
four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. 
Today the University has six major academic units. These are the 
College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities, the College of Business and Public 
Affairs, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, 
Education and Human Development, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association 
of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Computing Sciences 
Accreditation Board, Council on Accreditations of the National 
Recreation and Park Association, National Architectural Accrediting 
Board, National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and 
Certification, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 
National League for Nursing, and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in 
its primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main 
campus and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the 
State. The University is also heavily committed to a varied program of 
public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
