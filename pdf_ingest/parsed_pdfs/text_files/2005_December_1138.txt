HONORARY DEGREE 
THOMAS E. BARTON, JR. 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Through the leadership of Thomas E. Barton Jr., South Carolina's technical colleges have 
become recognizeJ as the gateway tu the American Jream - the learning resource needed 
tu sustain the state's economic viability and pro<luctivity. 
As president of Greenville Technical College since the institution's founding in 1962, he 
plays a key role in moving South Carolina to the new knowledge-based society of the 21" 
century. 
Dr. Barton graduated from Clemson in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree and 
received his Ed.D. in higher education administration from Duke University in 1972. He 
became president of Greenville Tech after serving in the public schools of South Carolina 
and Georgia as teacher, coach and school superintendent for nine years. 
The third largest higher education institution in South Carolina, Greenville Tech is a 
comprehensive technical college offering university transfer and technical programs to 
approximately 57,000 students annually. The college is the largest of the state's 16 
technical colleges and has an annual operating budget of $70 million, a physical plant 
valued at more than $100 million and approximately 1,200 faculty and staff members. 
Dr. Barton is recognized as a national leader in creating access to the learning that citizens 
need to participate productively in their communities and in the economy. He secured 
property and funding to expand Greenville Tech into a four-campus system to serve the 
most rapidly developing sectors of the county. He was also instrumental in establishing the 
University Center of Greenville, the largest multi-institutional center for higher 
education in the Southeast, and in launching the Greenville Education Network, a 
distance-learning initiative. 
For his commitment to making appropriate higher education available to all who can 
benefit from it, Dr. Barton has received many prestigious honors and awards. He was named 
to the "Blue Chipper's List" of the top 50 chief executive officers in community colleges by 
the University of Texas at Austin in 1988 anJ received the Thomas J. Peters Award for 
Leadership Excellence in the Community College in 1989. He received the Whitney M. 
Young Jr. Humanitarian Award from the Greenville Urban League in 1994. Named 
Business Person of the Year by Greenville Magazine in 1995, Dr. Barton has been chosen 
as one of the 50 most influential residents of Greenville by the publication every year 
since 1997. He was also named one of the top 25 leaders in the community by The 
Greenville News in 2000, 2001 and 2002. 
He was awarded honorary doctorates from Winthrop University in 2002 and from the 
University of South Carolina in 2004. Dr. Barton received the state's highest award for a 
civilian, the Order of the Palmetto, in 2003. He was also presented the Order of the 
Poinsettia and named the No. I Citizen of Greenville in 2003. 
Active in community affairs, Dr. Barton has served on the governing boards of the Greater 
Greenville Chamber of Commerce, Textile Hall Corp., the Historic Greenville 
Foundation, BB&T and the YMCA. He is a commissioner for the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools and has served on the board of directors of the Donaldson Air Force 
Base Museum and the S.C. Technical College Presidents' Council. He has served on the 
Executive Committee for Friends of the Greenville Hospital System and on the Governor's 
Task Force on Education in South Carolina. 
Tom Barton was an outstanding student athlete on Coach Frank Howard's 1951 Orange 
Bowl and 1952 Gator Bowl teams. He was named to the All State, All South and All 
American football teams in 1953 and was later drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers. For his 
athletic prowess, Dr. Barron was elected to the S.C. Athletic Hall of Fame and the 
Clemson University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1987. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of its 
own sons with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievements and 
meritorious contributions to higher education. It is a distinct privilege to honor Thomas E. 
Barton Jr. with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sc iences 
Architecture, Arcs, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science 
Engineering and Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps a re 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions with the President of C lemson University wearing a 
purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the 
panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates 
and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods 
are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the University 
Marshal. C lad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears 
the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the 
recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the 
coliseum. 

Page 8
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of C lemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University rega lia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

HISTORICAL ST A TEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson ( 1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering 
and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and 
the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, 
Georgia 30033-4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, 
Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are 
accredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 
American Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic 
Association, American Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science 
Accreditation Board, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related 
Education Programs (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, 
National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education, National League for Nursing Accrediting 
Commission, NRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation 
Board, and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
