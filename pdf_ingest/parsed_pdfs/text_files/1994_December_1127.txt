HONORARY DEGREE 
CARROLL A. CAMPBELL, JR. 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
The Honorable Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., who has been called the maker of modern 
governorship in South Carolina, is the 112th person to occupy the Office of Governor 
of South Carolina. 
Governor Campbell is only the second Republican in more than a century to attain 
the state's highest office. He is the immediate past chairman of the National Governors 
Association, and the 1994 Almanac of American Politics calls him " an exemplar of 
governing conservatism for the nation." 
Governor Campbell has defined the modern governorship in South Carolina and 
has positioned future governors to be major leaders in the development of public 
policy for the state as well as leading the state on the national scene. He is one of the 
few South Carolina governors to achieve a significant national reputation. 
Because of his leadership in restructuring state government, the Office of Governor 
is a much stronger institution. Capping his three-year effort to reform state government, 
Governor Campbell last year signed into law a sweeping overhaul plan that streamlined 79 agencies into 17, creating major new efficiencies and accountability measures. 
The governor is recognized at home and across the nation as a leader in education reform. He was a driving force behind the Cutting Edge, a major package of higher 
education initiatives, and Target 2000, which is known for its revolutionary measures 
that grant de-regulation and flexibility to our best-performing schools. 
Mr. Campbell's emphasis on literacy and the challenges of the global economy 
prompted him to develop the Governor's Initiative on Work Force Excellence, which 
has provided basic skills and literacy training at the work place to thousands of South 
Carolinians. 
Using his home state and personal experience on these issues, Governor Campbell championed the cause of " lifelong learning" as co-chair of the National Governors Association Task Force on Education and co-chair of the governors' historic education summit with the president. In this role he was co-author - along with thenGovernor Bill Clinton - of the six ambitious goals that arose from that meeting with 
President Bush. 
The governor's national leadership did not end when the goals were drafted 
and approved. He is former chairman of the National Education Goals Panel and past 
co-chairman of the National Council on Education Standards and Testing. 
His person-to-person style as a salesman for South Carolina, traveling from the 
Pacific Rim nations to the European Commonwealth, has helped produce an unprecedented $22 billion in capital investments for the state over the last seven and a half 
years and more than 230,000 new jobs. The American Economic Development Council 
honored him with its 1994 Excellence in Economic Development award for his hard 
work and successful innovations. 
In June 1992 Governor Campbell completed three years of intense, frequently 
secretive negotiations with the German carmaker BMW, resulting in the company's 
decision to build its first manufacturing plant outside Bavaria in Greer. It was the 
single largest economic development project announced in the United States that year. 
Clemson University salutes Governor Campbell for a distinguished career of public 
service to his state and nation. It is a distinct privilege for Clemson University to award 
the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to Governor Carroll Campbell.

HONORARY DEGREE 
JOHN W. DRUMMOND 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
The Honorable John Drummond of Ninety Six, veteran state legislator, decorated 
World War II fighter pilot and successful business executive in Greenwood, has served 
in the General Assembly for the past 30 years. 
Senator Drummond has long been a well-respected legislator who is listened to 
by friends and colleagues alike around South Carolina. His legislative interests cover 
a wide range of issues, including governmental reorganization. 
In his prestigious position as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a 
member of the Budget and Control Board, Senator Drummond oversees the annual 
preparation and passage of the Senate's version of the state appropriations bill. 
As a public servant, he has sought to use his legislative influence constructively. 
Senator Drummond has worked well both with Democratic and Republican governors 
and legislatures. Not a fierce partisan, he is known as one who tries to put the public 
interest above partisanship. 
His political career was launched in 1965 with his election to the South Carolina 
House of Representatives. Two years later, he was elected to the state Senate and 
has served continuously since then. 
As a businessman in his native Greenwood, he owns and operates a BP oil distributorship, serving as president of BP Oil Company and president of Greenwood Petroleum Company. 
During World War II, Captain Drummond served as a fighter pilot with the 405th 
fighter bomber group in England, France and Germany. His decorations include the 
Distiguished Flying Cross, two Purple Hearts, the Air Medal nine times, three Battle 
Stars and the Presidential Citation. 
In addition to the Finance Committee and Budget and Control Board, Senator 
Drummond also serves on the following: Fish, Game and Forestry Committee (first 
vice-chairman); Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee (first vice-chairman); Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee; Rules Committee; Interstate Cooperation; 
the Operations and Management Committee; and the Reorganization Commission 
(chairman). 
Senator Drummond has received numerous honors and awards throughout his 
distinguished legislative career. Recent ones include: induction into the Greenwood 
County Hall of Fame by Greenwood Area Chamber of Commerce (1992); recipient of 
the Order of The Palmetto from Governor Carroll A. Campbell, Jr. (1992); named 
Senator of the Year by the S. C. Student Legislature (1993); dedication of The John 
Drummond Complex, Lander University (1994); dedication of the John W. Drummond 
Engineering Industrial Technologies Center, Piedmont Technical College (1994); named 
Legislator of the Year by the S. C. Student Legislature (1994). 
Senator Drummond has long been a good legislative friend to Clemson University and has served on the Clemson University Board of Visitors and held membership 
in IPTAY since 1949. 
Clemson University holds Senator John Drummond's achievements and service 
to the people of South Carolina in the highest regard and wishes to express its deep 
and sincere appreciation for all he has done for this University through his years of 
service in the General Assembly. In recognition of this and all he has meant to the 
citizens of South Carolina, Clemson University presents the honorary degree, Doctor 
of Laws, to Senator John Drummond.

HONORARY DEGREE 
JOSEPH A. SHIRLEY 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Clemson alumnus and benefactor Joseph A. Shirley is a Clemson man in the 
truest sense of the word. 
Born in rural Greenwood County, he arrived at Clemson as a student with a 
strong desire for an education. Mr. Shirley worked his way through four years of 
college, graduating in 1940 with a Bachelor of Science degree in textile chemistry. 
He used his Clemson experience to enjoy professional and financial success. 
Known as Col. Shirley to his many friends in the Clemson family, he served his 
country for 30 years in the Army. During World War II he parachuted into Normandy 
and the Netherlands as an airborne infantry commander. He later served as a nuclear 
weapons officer. 
In a quiet and unassuming way, Col. Shirley has become one of the largest 
benefactors in Clemson's history. In 1981 he began making significant donations to 
the Clemson University Libraries in honor of his mother, Callie Jones Shirley, naming 
the endowment he established for her. 
Today, the Callie Jones Shirley Library has grown to more than $1.7 million, and 
most of this has been given by Col. Shirley. The endowment which he created is 
critical to the Libraries' ability to provide much needed information to its users. 
He was one of the first million-dollar donors to Clemson . Being a true philanthropist, he lives modestly in order to continue his support to the institution in which he 
believes - the institution that believed in him more than 50 years ago. 
Service and loyalty are virtually synonymous with Joe Shirley, as they have been 
integral parts of his life. He believes in Clemson and its mission and has been a 
consistent supporter since his retirement from the military in 1970. 
Mr. Shirley's support of the Libraries will forever benefit future generations of 
students, faculty and staff as well as the entire upstate community. His selection of 
the library as an area worthy of support was insightful, as the library supports all 
areas of the University. His undeterred loyalty is also shown through his involvement 
on the College of Liberal Arts Alumni Advisory Committee, the Library Development 
Advisory Committee and the Clemson University Foundation Board of Directors of 
which he is an honorary member. 
Friends know him as an individual of great principle and conviction who invests 
his resources only in organizations and causes in which he believes. Mr. Shirley has 
made a lifelong commitment of service, generosity and loyalty to Clemson, and his 
unyielding support, concern and love for the University have been an important part 
of its continued success in the development arena. 
In recognition of his remarkable life of service to his country and his support of 
and commitment to the highest academic quality of Clemson University, we present 
the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to Joe Shirley.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a 
senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American 
Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Dlsclpllne 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of 
medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States 
wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified 
by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually 
mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other 
degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, 
are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 
1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is 
marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are 
black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A 
second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and 
doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width 
of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim 
edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which 
designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice 
that the Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). 
Although many combinations are duplicated by dozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set 
forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in 
gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, 
the faculty do not exit as a part bf the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, 
when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of 
Clemson University and must be present at any convocation where the 
University, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any 
official convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, 
carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace 
rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the 
ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, 
thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle 
Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably 
going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, 
with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors 
represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in 
the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the 
whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of 
silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office" which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the seal of the University 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert 
Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of 
the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the 
batons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the 
lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson 
University. 

Page 11
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, 
the coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this 
institution: teaching, research and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. 
The bottom contains a series of open books representing the 
concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The 
white of the books and the purple of the background designate the 
teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and 
wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, 
as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The 
three symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also 
represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield 
bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of 
Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas 
Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become "the people's 
university" for South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, 
orange, white and gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, 
are the official colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Hlstorlcal Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-
1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington 
(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the 
founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his 
leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a 
national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of 
American Foresters, American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also 
heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the 
State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
