HONORARY DEGREE 
FRANK EDWARD LUCAS 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
At the pinnacle of the architectural profession, Frank Edward Lucas, FAIA, models the impact 
of a Clemson graduate's lifetime of integrity and service. 
The Charleston architect was inaugurated as the 45'h chancellor of the College of Fellows of the 
American Institute of Architects (AJA), the first South Carolinian to hold the honor. He is 
serving in 2007 during the AIA's 150'h anniversary. 
Few architects have had as profound an impact on the Southeast as Lucas, co-founder and 
chairman of LSJP ASSOCIATES LTD. The firm has grown from a one-man company in 1963 
to one of the largest architectural firms in the Southeast. With a staff of more than 250 and 
offices in Charleston, Columbia, Charlotte, Wilmington and Raleigh, LSJP has completed over 
$5 billion in architectural commissions. 
LSJP has received more than 175 local and national awards for design excellence from the 
American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the S.C. Arts Commission 
and others. 
Lucas is nationally known for contributions to his profession's licensure, examination and 
regulatory standards and procedures. In addition to AJA, he's held leadership roles in the 
Charleston Council of Architects, State Board of Architectural Examiners, National Council of 
Architectural Registration Boards and other professional organizations. Lucas is a recipient of 
the S.C. AIA's highest award, the Medal of Distinction, and was honored by the Charleston 
Contractors Association as Architect of the Year. 
Since graduating in 1959 with a bachelor of architecture degree, and serving as a captain in the 
Army Artillery, Lucas has contributed his time, talent and resources in a very profound and 
meaningful way to Clemson University. A charter member of the Presidents Club and an 
!PT A Y member, he has served three terms as president of the Clemson Advancement 
Foundation for Design + Building. He was also on the University's Board of Visitors, the 
College of Architecture Advisory Council and the President's Advisory Council, and has shared 
his expertise with students as a visiting lecturer for ethics, licensing law and professional 
practice. In 1992, he received the Clemson Alumni Distinguished Service Award. 
Lucas is involved in numerous civic organizations devoted to the arts, historic preservation, 
education and the economy. Among them: S.C. Chamber and Charleston Metro Chamber of 
Commerce, Hibernian Society, Girl Scouts of America, Charleston Arts and History 
Commission, S.C. Arts Foundation, Trident Technical College Foundation, Trident Economic 
Development Authority and MUSC Health Sciences Foundation. He was recognized for his 
contributions to the Charleston community in 1996 with the Joseph P. Riley Leadership Award. 
Lucas is a real estate broker, developer, architect and co-owner of The Charleston City Market, 
one of the most vibrant commercial areas in South Carolina. He is also a founding director of 
the rapidly growing Community First Bank and Carolina Financial Corp. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of our own 
alumni with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievement and 
meritorious contributions to his profession, his community and his alma mater. It is a distinct 
privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to Frank Lucas.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with 
the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science 
Engineering and Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval 
origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes 
specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black 
or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer 
than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves 
extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and 
the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to 
replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy 
(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped 
in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three 
velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not 
hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the 
Un iversiry Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the 
University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout 
the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic 
of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried 
by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is 
much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood 
and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors represented 
by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of 
South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" which 
were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the 
seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths 
of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor 
Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of 
Clemson University.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School 
of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; 
however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern 
planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington ( 1860). As a scientist he published 
numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in 
founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a political 
figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. 
Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. 
The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented by 
two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic units. 
These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the 
College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human 
Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be directed 
to Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 1866 
Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is also 
available at sacscoc.org. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, American Society of 
Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and Design, 
National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPNAALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American Foresters. 
Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five agricultural 
experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily committed to a 
varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
