HONORARY DEGREE 
MINORU OHNISHI 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Fuji Photo Film Chairman and CEO Minoru Ohnishi is a v1s1onary ~oth in the 
introduction of technology and in the recognition of the beneficial relationship between 
corporations, communities and universities. He has greatly contributed to the social and 
economic growth not only of Japan, but also to that of South Carolina. 
Mr. Ohnishi joined Fujifilm shortly after graduating from Tokyo University in 1948. 
His degree in economics coupled with his love of photography led to many early Fujifilm 
successes, including the introduction of the world's first Quick Snap one-time use 
recyclable camera, the manufacturing of ISO 400 color negative film and the 
development of the digital medical diagnosis system. 
Mr. Ohnishi was named manager of Fujifilm's New York office in 1964. In 1972, he 
became director of the board for the company and, after successful stints as both managing 
director and senior managing director, he was named president of Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. 
in 1980. 
In this role, Mr. Ohnishi made the decision to build the first Fujifilm factory in the 
United States in Greenwood, S.C., which opened in 1989. In 1996, Mr. Ohnishi was named 
chairman and CEO of Fuijifilm's global operations and continues to implement his vision 
of a strong international commercial partnership throughout North America and the 
world. 
The Greenwood community embraced Fujifilm, and the partnership has flourished. 
Fujifilm-Greenwood now has six major production facilities, a major research and 
development center and the largest Fujifilm distribution center in the world. The 
Greenwood complex is recognized as Fujifilm's North American manufacturing and R&D 
headquarters. Fujifilm has helped strengthen our state's economy, with more than 1,300 
associates employed in South Carolina and an annual payroll approaching $50 million. 
In 1997, Fujifilm made a contribution of $200,000 to help create the Greenwood 
Community Children's Center. The company has also given 100 cherry trees to 
Greenwood and has established scholarship programs at Clemson University, the 
University of South Carolina, Lander University and Piedmont Technical College for the 
benefit of Greenwood County students. 
Fujifilm and Clemson have partnered to form the U.S.-Japan Alliance with Clemson, 
an organization that furthers international relations through research and industry. The 
ties run strong: Mr. Hirokuni "Harry" Watanabe, president of Fujifilm's Greenwood 
operations and co-chair of the UJAC, serves as a member of the Commission on the Future 
of Clemson University, and Mr. Bill West, a Fujifilm-Greenwood's vice president of 
manufacturing, serves on the Advisory Board of the Industrial Engineering Department. 
Further, Fujifilm has had 23 Clemson co-op students since 1992 and recently enlisted 
several industrial engineering students to help address concerns related to process issues. 
In recognition of his contributions to the international partnership between the United 
States and Japan, to the state and constituency of South Carolina, and to the betterment of 
his communities and educational institutions, it is a distinct privilege to present Mr. 
Minoru Ohnishi with our first foreign national honorary degree, the Doctor of Laws.

HONORARY DEGREE 
WILLIAM LEON SCHACHTE, JR. 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Over the course of his exemplary careers as an officer and attorney in the United States 
Navy, Rear Admiral William Leon Schachte, Jr. has dedicated himself to the service of 
our nation and to the support of Clemson University. 
Rear Admiral Schachte began his military career as a shipboard officer after graduating 
from Officer Candidate School. He later volunteered for duty in Vietnam, serving in 
combat and earning the distinguished Bronze star with "Y" for "courage under fire and 
inspiring leadership." After receiving a law degree from the University of South Carolina 
under the Navy's Excess Leave Program, he furthered his service to our country through 
various assignments of increasing responsibility leading to over 10 years at the Pentagon. 
Rear Admiral Schachte later received a Master of Laws degree in international law with 
highest honors from the George Washington University Law School. 
An authority on the law of the sea, Rear Admiral Schachte has served as Department of 
Defense Representative for Ocean Policy Affairs, in which capacity he was senior 
spokesman for the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Rear Admiral Schachte demonstrated his skills in international diplomacy in law of the 
sea negotiations that ended in resolution of complex and sensitive issues with Russia, 
Canada, Greece, Turkey, Japan, and several Latin American and South Pacific nations. In 
acknowledgement of his diplomatic successes and his expertise in international ocean 
matters, he was nominated by the Department of Defense to represent the United States at 
the law of the sea tribunal in Hamburg, Germany. 
In his final military post as Acting Judge Advocate General of the Navy, he served as 
the senior uniformed lawyer in the Navy and Marine Corps, as personal legal and policy 
adviser to the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant 
of the Marine Corps. 
Over his outstanding record of service to our country, he has earned numerous personal 
awards, including the highest peacetime awards from both the Department of Defense and 
Department of the Navy, and he has received the prestigious Legion of Merit award twice. 
As a testimony to his religious faith, Rear Admiral Schachte was the keynote speaker at 
the 1995 Annual Mayor's Prayer Breakfast in Augusta, Ga. He was also the keynote 
speaker at the largest Mayor's Prayer Breakfast in America. 
Rear Admiral Schachte's leadership service to Clemson University began early at 
Clemson. As a student, he served as president of both his freshman and sophomore classes 
and went on to serve as president of the Student Senate. He also served as news editor of 
the Tiger, vice president of the Tiger Brotherhood, first president of the Interfraternity 
Council and president of Sigma Alpha Zeta, the first social fraternity at Clemson. 
Additionally, he was elected senator and later governor of the South Carolina State 
Student Legislature. 
Rear Admiral Schachte continues to serve the University as a member of the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities Advancement Board and as a Legislative Advocate. 
We hold Rear Admiral William L. Schachte and his lifetime achievements in the 
highest esteem. In recognition of his remarkable service to the United States of America 
and his contributions to Clemson University, it is a distinct privilege to present him with 
the Doctor of Laws honorary degree.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and comelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the bacons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the lace Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today ·the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on 
Accreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of 
Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O 'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.

HONORARY DEGREE 
SUSAN GOODWIN DELONY 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Esteemed University leader fo r two decades, Susan Goodw in Delony was instrumental in 
defining the social and educational culture of today's C lemson University. The 
contributions she made to students, colleagues and the future of C lemson are immeasurab le 
and resonate in the lives she personally touched and in those who never knew her but feel 
her impact today. 
Dean Delony received her bachelor's degree in 1945 from Auburn University and her 
master's from Cornell Un ive rsity in 1951. She followed her fo rmal e<lucation with summer 
studies at Michigan State and the Teachers College of Columbia University. 
Her first appointment in Academe was as an instructor at the Woman's College of North 
Caro lina, fo llowed by assistant professorships at Montana State Co llege and A uburn 
University. Dean Delony became the assistant dean of women at Auburn in 1957 an<l 
remained there until 1963 when she was hired as the first dean of women at C lemson. For 14 
years, she served in this post and was later promoted to associate dean of students. 
When Dean Delony joined C lemson's ranks, there was a great need for programs, 
opportunities and fac ilities fo r women. (They had been admitted to C lemson only yea rs 
before, in 1955.) Dean Delony met this challenge with resolve and passion. During her 
tenure, she was instrumental in the format ion and development of the Resi<lence H a 11 
Program for women and the Resident Assistant Program. In 1969, she brought nat io nal 
women's socia l fraternities to C lemson, establishing the foundat ion fo r the successful Greek 
Life the University enjoys today. She helped fou nd Alpha Lamba Delta freshman honor 
soc iety as well as Mortar Board. President Emeritus Walter Cox has ca lled hiring Dean 
Delany "one of the best recommendations I made in my tenure at C lemson." 
In add ition to her achi evements at the University, Dean Delony has provi<led 
outstand ing service to her community. While enjoy ing retirement in her birthplace of 
Tuscumbia, Alabama, she retains active membership in her church and has served on a 
feasibility study for the Consolidation Committee of Tuscumbia. She is past presi<lent nf the 
Maud Lindsay Study Club, volunteer of the Tennessee Valley Art Association Guild a nd 
has served and is currently on the Board of Friends of the Helen Keller Public Library. 
Dean Delony has made it her life's work to establish a high stan<lard nf characte r and 
vision for all with whom she has contact. Her spirit pervades the campus each and every <lay 
the University thrives. It is with great honor and pleasure that we recognize this individual 
who truly made a difference in the lives of stu<lents and of this University <luring a c ritical 
time in its history. We hereby present Susan Goo<lwin Delony with the honorary Doctor of 
Human ities degree.

HONORARY DEGREE 
ROBERT FRANCIS NOWACK 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
As a teacher, adviser, friend, confidant, colleague and mentor, Robert Francis Nowack 
epitomizes excellence. For over 50 years, he has served Clemson University in numerous 
capacities-from the Clemson Little Theatre to the Social Committee of Clem on 
College to being a charter member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He has contributed not only 
to Clemson University, but to tens of thousan<ls of students who now define the cultural, 
social an<l educational fabric of America. 
Professor Bob Nowack, or P.B. as he is better known, received his bachelor's <legree from 
Carnegie Mellon and a master's from the University of Pittsburgh. He also attended VP! 
for post-gra<luate work. He began teaching at Clemson on September l, 1948, and has been 
here ever since. 
Once referred to by President Emeritus Robert Edwards as "one of the truly great 
teachers in Clemson's first century of service to mankind," P.B. has served under seven of 
l 4 presi<lents and has won virtually every award the University bestows. He was the first 
recipient of the Byars Awar<l for Teaching Excellence in Engineering Mechanics and the 
Frank F. Burtner Awar<l for A<lvising. He has been a member of the Order of Athena 
Chapter of Mortar Boar<l National Honor Society, Tiger Brotherhood, Blue Key and Chi 
Epsilon. He's won the National Society of Professional Engineers Educator of the Year 
Award, Tau Beta Pi Eminent Engineer Award, Chi Epsilon Outstanding Teacher Award, 
Robert W . Moorman Award from Tiger Brotherhood, Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award 
and Master Teacher Award. In 1989 he was honore<l as an Alumni Distinguished Professor 
of Civil Engineering. 
Although highly decorate<l by official honors and awar<ls, P.B. is best known for his 
teaching style, his re lationship with students, his ability to befriend and father. He's been 
known to spen<l five hours per <lay just talking with students in his office. He learns every 
student's name in his classes, so he builds a personal relationship with each one of them. 
There are thousan<ls of students who are inspired by his wisdom and achieve beyond their 
hopes because of his encouragement. As one colleague sai<l, "P.B. does more than educate 
students; he makes them better human beings." 
Maybe P.B.'s contributions are best summarized in the words of one of his students: 
"What really sets you apart from other professors is your interest in each of your students as 
individuals, not merely as students. Teachers who take this kind of approach to students are 
the ones who truly make a <lifference in shaping our lives." 
Because of his dedication an<l genuine concern for stu<lents as well as his unsurpassed 
loyalty and 50-year service to Clemson University, we are honored to present Professor 
Robert Francis Nowack with the honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts and 
Humanities 
Business and Public Affairs

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty fo llow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academ ic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black ve lvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the award ing 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma ll est, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the C lemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron {a "Y"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is presently the only 
institution with chat registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green C lemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of sc ientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, 
Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for 
Management Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors 
of Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, 
and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultura l extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
