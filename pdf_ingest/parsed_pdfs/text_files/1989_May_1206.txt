HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
RUTH PATRICK 
Dr. Ruth Patrick is nationally known as a scientist, educational leader and 
consultant to industry and government in matters of environmental preservation 
and ecosystem balance. 
She is well-recognized in the scientific world for developing biological 
methods for environmental analysis, many of which have revolutionized analytical 
methodology for the evaluation of water quality. 
In South Carolina, Dr. Patrick has established the characteristics of the 
natural aquatic ecosystems in the Savannah River and its tributaries from which 
one can predict the effects of pollution. This study was started before the Savannah River Plant was built and has continued to the present for the Du Pont 
Company. 
She holds the Francis Boyer Chair of Limnology at the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia and is honorary chairman of the Academy's Board of 
Trustees. Dr. Patrick founded the Limnology Department at the Academy of 
Natural Sciences in 1947 and remained its cnairman until 1973. As a limnologist, 
she deals with the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of fresh 
waters, especially rivers. 
Dr. Patrick has written extensively on water resource management and the 
effects of water pollution. Industry's goal, she believes, must be to avoid waste 
production, or if wastes are produced, to recycle or mitigate them. Recycling 
also should be the aim of consumers. 
She notes that, in the future, attitudes toward water resources must change. 
There must be a monetary incentive for both industry and consumers to save 
water. She suggests that a water conservation ethic must be developed by every 
person if we are to effectively use but not abuse our water resources. 
A native of the midwest, Dr. Patrick was born in Topeka, Kansas, and grew 
up in Kansas City, Missouri. She earned a B.S. degree at Coker College in Hartsville and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Virginia. 
Her numerous honors and awards include the Merit Award of the Botanical 
Society of America (1971), the Eminent Ecologist Award of the Ecological Society 
of America (1972), the Philadelphia Award (1973), the John and Alice Tyler 
Ecology Award (1975), and the Gold Medal of the Royal Zoological Society of 
Antwerp, Belgium (1978). 
The author of three books and more than 140 scientific publications, Dr. 
Patrick is a member of the Board of Trustees of the World Resources Institute, 
the World Wildlife Fund/Conservation Foundation, and the Environmental and 
Energy Study Institute, all in Washington, D.C., and the Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, Missouri. 
Through her scientific expertise and leadership in her profession, Dr. Patrick 
has contributed greatly to a better quality of life throughout the world. Clemson 
University is honored to award this honorary doctoral degree to Dr. Ruth Patrick 
in recognition of her distinguished achievements.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
CLAYTON YEUTTER 
Dr. Clayton Yeutter, a native Nebraskan, who as a youngster was a high 
achiever in the 4-H program and later an articulate spokesman for the Cooperative Extension Service, was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate 
on February 8, 1989 and publicly sworn in as the 23rd United States Secretary of 
Agriculture on February 16. 
Dr. Yeutter, whose extensive knowledge of agriculture was gained through 
first-hand experience which began early in life, has an outstanding career which 
includes distinguished public and private-sector service in agricultural policy 
development, law, economics, marketing and trade. 
Secretary Yeutter believes in the strengths of America's rural areas and sees 
a bright future for the rural communities of the country as they adapt to the 
changing needs of the people in these communities. He is known for his solid 
understanding of the interrelationships of agriculture from production to consumption and all of the factors involved. He sets a high standard of excellence 
for himself and his colleagues. 
From July 1985 until the end of the Reagan administration, Dr. Yeutter served 
as U.S. Trade Representative. His previous USDA posts include assistant secretary for international affairs and commodity programs from March 1974 to June 
1975, assistant secretary for marketing and consumer services from January 1973 
to March 1974, and administrator of the consumer and marketing service from 
October 1970 to December 1971. 
Dr. Yeutter's other career highlights include president and chief executive 
officer of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, July 1978 to June 1985; senior partner, law firm of Nelson, Harding, Yeutter & Leonard, Lincoln, Nebraska, April 1977 
to June 1978; deputy U.S. Special Trade Representative, June 1975 to February 
1977; director, University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia (a large agricultural 
technical assistance program), September 1968 to October 1970; executive assistant to the governor of Nebraska, January 1966 to September 1968; faculty member, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Nebraska, January 1960 
to January 1966; operator of a 2,500 acre farming-ranching-cattle feeding enterprise in central Nebraska, 1957-1975; and enlistee, later commissioned officer, 
U.S. Air Force, 1952-1957. 
A native of Eustis, Nebraska, Dr. Yeutter earned three degrees at the University of Nebraska. He was graduated with high distinction in 1952 with a Bechelor 
of Science degree in animal husbandry. In 1963 he received his law degree, 
graduating cum laude and ranking first in his class. In 1966 he received his 
doctorate in agricultural economics and was named outstanding graduate student 
in the program. 
D;. Yeutter, a personable and versatile leader, is a family man who believes 
in the family and strong family values as essential to the fabric of the American 
way of life. He and his wife, Jeanne, a home economist by profession, have four 
children. 
Clemson University holds him and his achievements in the highest regard, 
and it is a special privilege to honor him with the awarding of this honorary 
degree.

The President's Award 
DR. RUSSELL G. MAWBY 
Dr. Russell G. Mawby is chairman of the Board of Trustees and 
chief executive officer of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, among the 
largest private philanthropic organizations in the world. He is a 
member of the President's Advisory Council at Clemson University. 
Dr. Mawby grew up on a farm in western Michigan and has degrees 
in horticulture and agricultural economics from Michigan State and 
Purdue. He later served on the faculties of both institutions. In 
1965 he joined the staff of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of Battle 
Creek, Michigan, as director of the Division of Agriculture, becoming vice president in 1967 and president and chief executive officer 
in 1970. He was named chairman of the Board in 1982, while continuing as chief executive officer. Established in 1930 to "help 
people help themselves," The Foundation has distributed more 
than $1 billion in support of programs in agriculture, education, 
and health. Grants to Clemson University have helped introduce 
microcomputers into Clemson's Cooperative Extension Programs, 
provide an agricultural literacy program to enhance awareness of 
agriculture and nutrition among faculty and students in nonagricultural disciplines, provide an orientation program for new faculty, 
and develop rural leadership in South Carolina. Clemson is honored 
to present this award to Russ Mawby as a symbol of our sincere 
thanks for all he does for this University.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size cf the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
