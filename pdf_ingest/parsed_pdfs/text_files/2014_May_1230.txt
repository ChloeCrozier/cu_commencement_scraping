PRESIDENTIAL BIOGRAPHY 
James Patrick Clements 
President, Clemson University 
Today, Clemson University is proud to install James Patrick Clements as 
the University's fifteenth president. 
Just as each of today's graduates receives a diploma, symbolizing years 
of academic work and achievement, President Clements will receive the 
academic regalia and other official symbols of office. These include the 
purple robe with velvet bars and University seal; the presidential chain 
and seal; a copy of the will of Thomas Green Clemson; and the Act of 
Acceptance establishing the University in 1889. 
Jim Clements officially assumed the office of president on December 31, 
2013, after serving nearly five years as president of West Virginia University. He is also a professor in 
the School of Computing, College of Engineering and Science, at Clemson. 
A native of Virginia, he holds a B.S. degree in computer science and M.S. and Ph.D. in operations 
analysis from the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and an M.S. in computer science from 
Johns Hopkins University. He has published and/or presented more than 75 papers in the fields 
of computer science, higher education, information technology, project management and strategic 
planning. He also served as principal investigator or co-PI on more than $15 million in research grants. 
During Clements' tenure at WVU, the university set records in private fundraising, enrollment, 
research and patients served through the health system, and reached 95 percent of its $750 million 
capital campaign goal two years ahead of schedule. 
Prior to his service at WVU, Clements served as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, 
Vice President for Economic and Community Outreach, and the Robert W. Deutsch Distinguished 
Professor of Information Technology at Towson University, the second largest university in the 
University System of Maryland. He also led the Center for Applied Information Technology, which 
was a strategic, entrepreneurial initiative for the university, chaired Towson's Department of Computer 
and Information Sciences and was a consultant to numerous private-sector companies. His Successful 
Project Management book is now in its 6th edition and is published in multiple languages and used in 
numerous countries. 
Clements is a nationally recognized voice in higher education who currently serves as chair-elect of 
the APLU Board of Directors; co-chair of APLU's Energy Forum; chair of the American Council 
on Education's Commission on Leadership; and member of the Business Higher Education Forum 
and the Council on Competitiveness. He previously served on the U.S. Department of Commerce 
Innovation Advisory Board. 
The son of Joseph Harvey Clements Jr. and the late Geraldine Grace Clements, our new president 
is a devoted family man. He and his wife, the former Beth Smith, have four children. Son Tyler and 
daughter Maggie are students at West Virginia University. Maggie's twin sister Hannah just completed 
her freshman year at Clemson, and Grace attends Robert C. Edwards Middle School. Ties to Clemson 
University run deep, as several members of Beth's family are also Clemson alumni. 
As our fifteenth president, Clements will lead the University in its pursuit of academic excellence and 
international acclaim while striving to promote a happy, healthy environment for students, faculty and 
staff. 
Join us in welcoming President Jim Clements and his entire family as members of the Clemson Family.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in orange and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in orange for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of C lemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with C lemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the governing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
C lemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr. C C Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
(1807 -1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a 
scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced 
only two four-year curricu la, supplemented by two two-year 
preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions 
about the accreditation of C lemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association 
to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council 
for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association 
(CADE), American Society of landscape Architects, Commission 
on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs 
(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPN AALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available 
in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged 
not only in its primary academic program, but does extensive 
research at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment 
stations located in the state. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultura l extension, which has professional personnel 
located in each of the state's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
0' er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
0' er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.

Today, James P. Clements, Ph.D., will receive the official 
symbols of the Office of the President of Clemson University 
THE RoBE AND HooD 
The wearing of academic regalia is an ancient practice, dating 
to medieval times. The president of Clemson University wears 
a purple robe with four velvet bars, piped in orange, on each 
sleeve and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The 
Clemson University hood is lined in purple with an orange 
chevron. 
THE PRESIDENTIAL CHAIN AND SEAL 
The Presidential Chain and Seal are symbolic of the authority 
vested in the Office of the President by the governing body 
of the University. Only the University president may wear 
it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. The president is invested with a chain of office to 
show his civil, rather than his academic, status. 
The Clemson chain is made of silver with a purple amethyst set 
into one shoulder link and an orange carnelian into the other, 
the symbolic colors of the University. The pendant is a silver 
and gold relief of the University seal. The Presidential Chain 
and Seal were presented to President R. C. Edwards and used 
for the first time at the May 1971 commencement ceremony. 
THE WILL OF THOMAS GREEN CLEMSON 
In 1886, Thomas Green Clemson signed his will, leaving his 
814-acre Fort Hill plantation and $80,000 of his personal estate 
to the state of South Carolina to establish a "high seminary 
of learning." That institution, originally known as Clemson 
Agricultural College, opened in July 1893 with 446 students. 
In 1964, the college was renamed Clemson University. 
THE Acr OF AccEPTANCE 
Even after Thomas Green Clemson's death in 1888, the 
establishment of the University was not assured. The South 
Carolina Legislature had to accept the bequest and the 
stipulations placed within it. On November 27, 1889, Governor 
John P. Richardson signed the bill accepting Thomas Green 
Clemson's will, thus establishing the college. That bill has come 
to be known as the Act of Acceptance.
