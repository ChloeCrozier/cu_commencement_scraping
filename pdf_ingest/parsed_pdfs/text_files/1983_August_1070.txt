HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
M. MACEO NANCE, JR. 
The presidency of S. C. State College in Orangeburg marks the culmination of 
a nearly lifelong association for M. Maceo Nance, Jr. He received his bachelor's 
degree from the school in 1949 and, after earning his master's from New York 
University, embarked on a quest to improve educational opportunities for black 
students in South Carolina. 
One of Dr. Nance's early positions with S. C. State was as manager of the 
Student Union. At the time, State had some 2,000 students enrolled in classes 
utilizing an assembly of aging buildings. T·here was work to be done, and Dr. 
Nance .was the one with the vision and the determination to accomplish it. 
From that modest beginning, Maceo Nance began to work his way up the 
administrative ladder at S. C. State. From Assistant Business Manager to Business 
Manager, from Vice President for Business and Finance to Acting President, 
Nance demonstrated administrative skill and integrity. He ascended to the presidency of the school in 1968 at the age of 41. 
But Maceo Nance has not been content to sit back and watch the world go by. 
While striving for quality at S. C. State, he has not lost sight of the needs of black 
students elsewhere. He has involved himself with many national educational organizations including the National Association of Equal Opportunity ·in Higher 
Education, the Commission on Federal Relations of the American Council on 
Education and the National Association for Advancement of Public Negro 
Colleges. 
Improving his community has also been a priority. Dr. Nance is a life member 
of the NAACP, and serves on the board of directors of Bankers Trust of South 
Carolina, the United Way of South Carolina and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
South Carolina. 
Dr. Nance's contributions have not gone unnoticed. He has received honorary 
degrees from Morris Brown College, Francis Marion College, the University of 
South Carolina and The Citadel. He has also been awarded the Outstanding 
Civilian Service Medal by the Army and honored "for distinguished service in 
education and the community" by the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. 
Along the way, Maceo Nance has found the time to raise a family. He and his 
wife, the former Julie E. Washington, have two children. Mrs. Nance, by the way, 
is an alumna of S. C. State. 
Today, S. C. State College has a total enrollment of roughly 4,000 students. 
State recently completed a ten-year building and renovation program. It is estimated that more than 40 percent of South Carolina's black citizens have some tie, 
direct or indirect, to the institution. That means better than a million people have 
been touched by the work of this man. 
For his contributions to higher education in South Carolina; for his commitment 
to progress for all people through knowledge and learning; for his lifetime of 
service to mankind as an educator and conscientious citizen of this state and 
nation, Clemson University is proud to present the honorary Doctor of Humanities 
degree to M. Maceo Nance, Jr.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
JAMES MADISON WADDELL, JR. 
"Some people see things as they are and say why," said the 
late Senator Robert F. Kennedy. "/ dream things that never 
were and say why not." 
JAMES MADISON WADDELL, JR., a man of action as well as dreams, has devoted a lifetime to saying .why not for South Carolina. 
Why not, he asked, when the dream was to find a rational and feasible way to 
manage use of South Carolina's coastline so as to protect its quality and fragile 
beauty while enjoying 'its recreational and economic benefits. 
Why not, he asked, when the dream was to provide better, more effective care 
and services for the state's mentally ill citizens by developing the "village concept" and community mental health facilities. 
Why not, he asked, when the dream was to establish a research and development center to provide for "saltwater agriculture," a field with tremendous economic promise for South Carolina, the same sort of scientific and scholarly 
support provided for traditional forms of agriculture by the South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. In fitting tribute to his vision and forward-thinking, 
this facility, which is currently under construction, will be known as the James M. 
Waddell, Jr. Mariculture Research and Development Center. 
These are but a fe.w of the dreams Senator James Waddell has helped his fellow South Carolinians realize during his long and distinguished career as one of 
the state's most able, most respected, and most dedicated public servants. 
Senator Waddell was born on November 1, 1922, in Boydell, Arkansas, but his 
links to South Carolina reach back a century to when his great-grandmother left 
the Cheraw area with her family to farm cotton ·in Arkansas. The family returned 
to South Carolina in the 1920s. 
After interrupting his education to serve with distinction as a soldier in World 
War II - during which he was wounded and received numerous medals for valor, 
including The Bronze Star and The Purple Heart - Senator Waddell resumed his 
studies at The Citadel, from which he was graduated in 1947. Having settled in 
Beaufort County, he made his first bid for public office in 1954, prompted by a 
desire to help improve health care in the Lowcountry. Winning that race for the 
State House of Representatives, he served there until 1958. He has been elected 
to the State Senate every four years since 1960 and currently is fourth in seniority ·in that body. 
Senator Waddell has fought tirelessly and successfully for such landmark legislation as the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Sea Grants Act, the Education 
Finance Act, the Tax Equalization Program Act, and the Joint Appropriations 
Review Committee Act, to name just a few. 
In addition to his ,work in the Senate, he has served and continues to serve the 
state in a myriad of other leadership roles. At present he chairs the South Carolina Coastal Council, the Tax Study Commission, the Boundary Commission, and 
this University's Board of Trustees, of which he is a Life Member. 
Clemson University is proud to present to one of its own this honorary Doctor 
of Laws degree in recognition of his outstanding record of unselfish, sensitive 
and effective service to the people of South Carolina.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
r ... 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale, 
Here the Tigers lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our Alma Mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
