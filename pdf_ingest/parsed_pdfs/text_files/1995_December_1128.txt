HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LETTERS 
JACK C. MCCORMAC 
South Carolinian and Clemson Professor Emeritus Jack McCormac consistently 
has been one of the most effective and highly regarded classroom teachers at the 
University, but he has gained his greatest recognition as an author of textbooks. He 
has published seven major texts and is considered to be among the leading authors 
of engineering texts in the world. 
Professor McCormac was born in Columbia and earned undergraduate and 
graduate degrees in civil engineering at The Citadel and at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. He joined the faculty at Clemson where he taught civil 
engineering for 36 years. He attained the level of full professor and was named to a 
prestigious alumni distinguished professorship, winning great praise from his 
students for his teaching style, enthusiasm and his ability to motivate them. 
Professor McCormac has written and published several editions of texts on 
subjects of structural analysis, structural steel design, reinforced concrete design and 
surveying. His textbooks have been adopted at more than 500 colleges and 
universities around the world and have been translated into five languages. More 
than 750,000 texts authored by him have been sold. In addition, he has written parts 
of several significant engineering handbooks. 
His worldwide reputation as a distinguished civil engineer educator has helped 
Clemson solidify its position as an outstanding undergraduate education institution. 
His many honors and awards include an endowed alumni professorship, AT&T 
award from the American Society for Engineering Education, Educator of the Year 
from the Piedmont Chapter of the S.C. Society of Professional Engineers, a national 
citation from the American Institute of Steel Construction, a chapter honor member of 
Chi Epsilon (civil engineering honor society), Distinguished Practicing Engineering 
Award from Tau Beta Pi and Distinguished Alumnus of The Citadel. 
Professor McCormac embodies those ideals that Clemson University values. 
His wide recognition and respect as an author and educator place him in a unique 
position to represent Clemson and its educational mission to audiences throughout 
the world. 
It is indeed a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes 
and honors one of its own with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent 
achievement in scholarship and genuine service to the world academic community. 
We all are extremely proud of the enormous impact he has made on civil engineering 
education through his many textbooks as well as his teaching of several thousand 
civil engineering students in his years at Clemson. 
We hold Professor Emeritus Jack McCormac and his lifetime achievements in 
the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the presentation of 
the Doctor of Letters.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
THOMAS SAMUEL MOORMAN, JR. 
Air Force General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr., whose family ties to Clemson are rooted in the 
early days of the college itself, is vice chief of staff, Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, Washington, 
D.C. 
General Moorman, who was promoted to general on August 1, 1994, has served in a variety 
of intelligence and reconnaissance-related positions within the United States and worldwide. 
While stationed at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, in 1982, he became deeply involved in 
planning and organizing the establishment of Air Force Space Command. As commander and 
vice commander of Air Force Space Command, General Moorman was responsible for operating 
military space systems, ground-based radars and missile warning satellites, the nation's space 
launch centers at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, the 
worldwide network of space surveillance radars, as well as maintaining the Intercontinental 
Ballistic Missile force. 
General Moorman was born in Washington, D.C., and received his undergraduate 
education at Dartmouth College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and political 
science and was commissioned through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps as a 
distinguished military graduate in 1962. General Moorman also has a master's degree in 
business administration from Western New England College (1972), and a master's degree in 
political science from Auburn University (1975). 
In 1995 General Moorman received the prestigious Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy 
for his contributions to the nation's space program. The recipient is chosen annually for great 
achievement in advancing space flight programs which contribute to U.S. leadership in 
astronautics. 
Although not a Clemson alumnus, General Moorman's ties to Clemson historically have 
been very strong, and his is one of Clemson's historic family names. His grandfather, Thomas S. 
Moorman, graduated as a member of Clemson's first class in 1896, became a career officer, and 
years later returned to Clemson as colonel and professor of military science and tactics. He later 
held the position of commandant. Since that time the Moorman family has continued a direct 
relationship to Clemson. 
General Moorman's father, also named Thomas, is now a retired Air Force lieutenant 
general living in Colorado Springs where he served his last assignment as superintendent of the 
Air Force Academy. The honoree's uncle, Robert Moorman, graduated from Clemson and served 
as a faculty member, was head of the engineering mechanics department, and coached the 
University golf team. 
An aunt, Betty Moorman, worked in the University's business and finance office for 34 years 
and is now retired and lives in Clemson. Another aunt, the late Marie Moorman Grimes, was a 
secretary to Dean Sams of the former School of Engineering. The Moorman tradition at Clemson 
continued as the general's son, John Moorman, graduated from Clemson in 1992. 
We hold General Thomas Moorman and his lifetime achievements in the highest esteem, 
and it is a distinct privilege to honor him for his untold contributions to our nation's defense and 
to the unparalleled success of the U.S. space program. We present him the honorary degree of 
Doctor of Laws.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and 
honored guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is 
preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described 
under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a 
combination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college . These 
colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as 
follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts and 
Humanities 
Business and Public Affairs

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing 
academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from 
institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' 
institutions are specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council 
on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of 
Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or 
discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' 
gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that 
terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels 
and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with 
black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline 
color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the 
awarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with 
bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging 
the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, 
which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the 
hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University 
hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a ''V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently 
the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or 
military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the 
University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty 
do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and 
guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of 
Clemson University and must be present at any convocation where the 
University, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any 
official convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, 
carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace 
rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the 
ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, 
thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle 
Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably 
going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, 
with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors 
represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). 
Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in 
the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for 
the whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of 
silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office" which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the seal of the University 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert 
Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of 
the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the 
batons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the 
lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson 
University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, the 
coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this 
institution: teaching, research and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. The 
bottom contains a series of open books representing the concept of 
teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the 
University as it is achieved through undergraduate and graduate 
instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and 
wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as 
well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three 
symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the 
humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a 
white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas Green 
Clemson's desire that Clemson become "the people's university" for 
South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, orange, white and 
gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official colors of 
the University; the inner pair, orange and white, are Clemson's student 
colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-
1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the 
founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at 
the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was 
that of a mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his 
interests into politics and the life of a southern planter, and he soon 
became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and 
served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in 
Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the 
fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. 
Calhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half 
of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved 
on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two 
four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. 
Today the University has six major academic units. These are the 
College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities, the College of Business and Public 
Affairs, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, 
Education and Human Development, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association 
of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the 
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Computing Sciences 
Accreditation Board, Council on Accreditations of the National 
Recreation and Park Association, National Architectural Accrediting 
Board, National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and 
Certification, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 
National League for Nursing, and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in 
its primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main 
campus and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the 
State. The University is also heavily committed to a varied program of 
public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
