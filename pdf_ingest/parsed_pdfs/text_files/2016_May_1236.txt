HONORARY DEGREE 
Jeffrey Robert lmmelt 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Jeffrey R. Immelt is the ninth chairman of GE, a post he has 
held since September 7, 2001. Mr. Immelt has held several global 
leadership positions since coming to GE in 1982, including roles 
in GE's Plastics, Appliances, and Healthcare businesses. In 1989 
he became an officer of GE and joined the GE Capital Board 
in 1997. In 2000 Immelt was appointed president and chief 
executive officer. 
Im melt was the chair of President Obama's Council on Jobs and 
Competitiveness. He is a member of The American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Immelt 
earned a B.A. degree in applied mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1978 and an 
M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1982. 
Immelt believes that business success and philanthropic efforts are mutually beneficial. 
He has said: "We want to be a company that is always getting better. A company that 
understands where it fits in the markets and in society and appreciates its responsibility 
to both." GE has been named by Fortune as "America's Most Admired Company," and 
Im melt has been repeatedly named one of the "World's Best CEO's" by Barron's. Under 
Immelt's leadership, GE has been listed among the country's most charitable companies. 
General Electric has generously and consistently supported education, technology and 
health care initiatives around the globe. GE, under the leadership of Im melt has been a 
key partner with Clemson University in the study of innovative technology and workforce 
development - on campus and in the innovation campuses across the state. From 
advanced materials manufacturing research at Clemson University-International Center for 
Automotive Research to wind turbine technology advancement at the Energy Innovation 
Center in Charleston, the partnership between GE and Clemson in research, testing, 
technological advancement and preparation of workforce-ready graduates has been mutually 
beneficial. 
For his continued partnership with Clemson University as well as his devotion to excellence 
in business and to improving the lives of citizens around the globe, Clemson University is 
proud to bestow on Jeffrey Robert Immelt the honorary Doctorate of Humanities degree.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guest of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
de cribed under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the discipline taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate facu lty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United State wear costumes specified by the award ing 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are pecified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the award ing institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hood to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
award ing institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the C lemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of in titutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The pre ident of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in orange and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in orange for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood anJ bears the university mace. At the ceremony's do e, the facu lty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic repre entation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be pre ent at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace re ts before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic dub-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man' prehi tory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors repre ented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the governing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the univer ity seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the variou discipline in et with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr.CC Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
( 1807-1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a 
scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 
with an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" 
announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented by two 
two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has seven 
major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts 
and Humanities; the College of Business and Behavioral 
Science; Eugene T Moore School of Education; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions 
about the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association 
to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council 
for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association 
(CADE), American Society of Landscape Architects, Commission 
on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs 
(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPA/ AALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available 
in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged 
not only in its primary academic program, but does extensive 
research at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment 
stations located in the state. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension, which has professional personnel 
located in each of the state's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
