Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), 
\vho left the bulk of lus estate to the State of South Carolina for the 
founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson v;as born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mmes in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that 
of a mining engineer; but circumstances di,·erted his interests into politics 
and the life of a Southern Planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge 
d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852), and served as the first superintendent of 
agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published 
numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, and agriculture. His 
varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland 
Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in the founding of Clemson 
University. 
Tl1omas Clemson \Vas the son-in-la\v of South Carolina's John C. 
Calhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half of 
the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on 
the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. The first .. college prospectus" announced only two four-
)?ear curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses Today 
Cle1nson University's enrollment is 5400 and the current catalog lists 
thirty-eight undergraduate and thirty-nine graduate curricula. 
The University has seven major academic units. These are the College 
of Agriculture and Biological Sciences; the School of Architecture; the 
College of Arts and Sciences; the School of Education; the College of 
Engineering; the School of Industrial Management and Textile Science; 
and the School of Graduate Study. 
The institution became an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927. The civil, electrical, ai1d mechanical 
engineering curricula we1 e accredited by the Engineers1 Council for Pro-
(ess1onal Development in 1937. Curricula in agricultural, ceramic, and 
chemical engineering were accredited by ECPD in 1953, 1955, and 1959, 
respectively. 
The chemistry curriculum was first accredited by the American Chemical Society in 1953 and the architectural curriculum by the National Architectu1 al Accrediting Board in 1956. The forestry curriculum was accredited 
by the Society of American Foresters in 1962. 
Clemson is the Land-Grant University of South Carolina. As such the 
institution is engaged not only in its primary academic program, but does 
extensive research at the main campus and at six agricultural experiment 
stations located in the state. The University is also heavily committed to 
a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the state's 
counties.
