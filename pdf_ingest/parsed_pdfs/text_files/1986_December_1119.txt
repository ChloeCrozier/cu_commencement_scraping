HONORARY DEGREE 
JAMES DICKEY 
DOCTOR OF HUMANE LETTERS 
James Dickey is considered among the major writers of our time. His poetry 
and other writings are the object of wide acclaim, and his oratorical skills have 
marked him as one of the finest public readers of his own poetry since Dylan 
Thomas took the nation by storm in the 1950s. 
He has been broadly honored by critics and the public press, and his national 
recognition reached honorific peaks with his two-year appointment as Consultant 
in Poetry in English for the Library of Congress in 1966, and his televised reading 
of "The Strength of Fields" at the inaugural celebration for President Jimmy 
Carter in 1977. 
He has pursued life with a robustness, doing more things and accomplishing 
more in one lifetime than most people could hope for in several. For Mr. Dickey, 
as he recounts in the autobiographical Self-Interviews of 1970, to be an artist is 
also to be entrenched in the active life. He calls the poet "the intensified man," 
believing strongly in the pursuit of "wholeness." 
A native of Atlanta, Mr. Dickey earned A.B. and M.A. degrees at Vanderbilt 
University and is presently Carolina Professor of English and Writer-in-Residence 
at the University of South Carolina. 
His Clemson roots go back more than four decades to 1942 when he was a student-athlete and played wingback on the freshman football team. In "The 
Bee," a poem which he dedicated to the football coaches of Clemson College, 
1942, he alludes to his days as a Clemson football player and credits that training and experience with helping him to save a son from impending danger. 
He was an aviator in World War II, flying approximately 100 missions for the 
41 Bth Night Fighters in the South Pacific. He was recalled for service by the Air 
Force during the Korean War. 
In 1956, at age thirty-three, he began a six-year stint in the business world 
as a successful advertising copywriter for firms in New York and Atlanta. However, he had not resigned his other career as a poet and wrote ad copy by day 
and poetry by night. He was off to Europe in 1961 on a Guggenheim Fellowship, 
and by 1967 had published five volumes of poetry, climaxed by the National Book 
Award for Buckdancer's Choice. 
For those who had not known and delighted in the pleasures of his great 
literary talent before 1970, the publication of his very successful novel Deliverance 
and his script for the highly acclaimed movie version made him famous almost 
beyond the hopes of any American poet. 
In 1974 his Jerico: The South Beheld, a luxury book of prose poems and 
illustrations about the South, was published and became a fixture on coffee 
tables in Southern homes. New works include a novel, Alnilam, a children's book, 
Bronwen, the Traw and the Shape-Shifter, and a volume of poems. 
Clemson University is honored that James Dickey has accepted our invitation to be the recipient of an honorary doctoral degree. We hold him and his 
achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a privilege for all of us to honor 
not only a good Clemson alumnus and friend, but an individual who has contributed so much to the field of American literature and poetry.

HONORARY DEGREE 
RICHARD W. RILEY 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
The Honorable Richard W. Riley, twice elected governor of the State of 
South Carolina, has provided effective, progressive and distinguished leadership 
for South Carolinians in a decade of considerable growth and transition. 
He has been able not only to envision progressive reforms, but also to work 
within the established system to bring about reform. It has been said that in 
fighting for reform, he gains the respect of all, even those who oppose his position. 
Governor Riley has been a good friend of public education and a leading 
exponent of educational reform. A top priority of his Administration has been 
improvement of public education with major emphasis in grades K through 12. 
He committed his full energies to that goal and was the driving force behind 
enactment of the Education Improvement Act of 1984, which was judged the 
most comprehensive educational reform measure in the nation by a RAND Corporation study. 
This victory earned him national recognition among his gubernatorial peers 
and placed him among two or three governors who have had a decided impact 
on educational reform. In a Newsweek poll this year of the nation's governors, 
he was ranked among the three most effective governors by his colleagues. 
Governor Riley indeed has established himself as a national leader among 
governors, and in so doing, has brought much favorable attention to South Carolina. He has been an able spokesman on issues which are crucial to the State, 
including nuclear waste disposal, preventive health care, and educational reform. 
His contributions as a constructive and stabilizing force within the national Democratic party are well-known. 
He is a native of Greenville where he earned an A.B. degree at Furman 
University, graduating cum laude in political science. He also holds a juris doctor 
degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law. 
Governor Riley served in the South Carolina House and Senate, and was 
elected to his first term as Governor in November 1978. He was reelected in 
November 1982, becoming the first governor in modern South Carolina history to 
succeed himself in office. 
Many well-deserved honors and awards decorate his long career of public 
service and achievement. They include the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center "Government Social Responsibility Award," the "Connie Award" for special conservation achievement from the National Wildlife Federation, and the National Service 
Medal from the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge for his leadership in the 
national movement for public education reform. 
History probably will record his administration as one of the most progressive and beneficial to the State of South Carol ina in modern times. 
Clemson University salutes Governor Riley for his outstanding achievements. 
It is a very special privilege for us to honor him and to express appreciation for 
all that he has meant to our great state.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
