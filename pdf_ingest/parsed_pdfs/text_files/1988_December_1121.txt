HONORARY DEGREE 
WARREN H. OWEN 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Clemson alumnus Warren H. Owen is one of the top corporate leaders of 
Duke Power Company at its headquarters in Charlotte, N. C. 
Mr. Owen is executive vice president of the company's power group, which 
involves overall responsibility for engineering, construction, production, and generation and information services. But as busy as he is, he always has time for 
Clemson. He is known as one of the University's most dedicated and enthusiastic 
alumni and is currently serving a second term as president of the Clemson Alumni 
Association and the Alumni National Council. He also has served on the College 
of Engineering Advisory Board and on search committees which have filled three 
executive level positions at Clemson University. 
He played a crucial role in the highly successful campaign among Duke 
Power employees which raised $1.3 million for academics at Clemson. The Duke 
Power/Clemson University Campaign was in celebration of the University's Centennial. On Nov. 29 one of the distinguished professorships to be funded from the 
campaign was named the Warren H. Owen Distinguished Professorship of Engineering in his honor - an action which underscores the high esteem in which he 
is held both by colleagues and employees at Duke. 
Mr. Owen earned his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, graduating in 1947 with high honors. He joined Duke Power Company as an engineer in 
the steam production department the following year and served in various positions before being assigned to the general office in 1954. He was transferred to 
the design engineering department in 1962 and was made principal mechanical 
engineer in 1966. He was elected vice president of design engineering in 1971, 
senior president of engineering and construction in 1978 and executive vice 
president of engineering and construction in 1982. He accepted additional responsibilities as executive vice president of the power group during a reorganization 
in October 1988. 
He was elected to the Board of Directors and executive committee of Duke 
Power in 1978. 
Since becoming principal engineer in 1966, Mr. Owen has accumulated an 
impressive record of accomplishments. His increasing level of involvement and 
responsibility in the design and construction of power plants led to placing in 
operation 14,295 megawatts of productive capacity. Half of this capacity is comprised of seven nuclear units. Additionally, he is now directing the company's 
efforts toward completion of four pumped-storage hydroelectric units with a combined capacity of 1,000 megawatts. 
Under his leadership these fossil and nuclear generation plants were designed and constructed to achieve one of the industry's highest levels of operating performance and efficiency. Duke Power has had the number one fossilgathering system in the country for the past 14 years and finishes high in total 
generating efficiency, both nuclear and fossil, each year. 
His many honors and awards include the Atomic Industrial Forum's Clyde A. 
Lilly, Jr. Award which he received for managing recovery efforts at Three Mile 
Island in 1979. In 1987 he received the James N. Landis Medal from the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
Clemson is indeed fortunate to have alumni like Warren Owen who are committed to its future and eager to work for its continued advancement. It is a very 
special privilege to honor one of our own with the presentation of this honorary 
degree.

The President's Award 
DR. ROBERT ROY PEARCE 
Friends and associates alike know this Clemson graduate as one 
of the University's most active and dedicated alumni - Columbia 
businessman and distinguished war veteran Dr. R. Roy Pearce. He 
is a member of the Class of 1941 that marched out of college and 
off to a world war in which about one-fourth of the 409 graduates 
gave their lives in defense of their country. 
He long has been an enthusiastic supporter of programs to 
achieve greater overall excellence at his alma mater. On December 
13, President Lennon announced that Dr. Pearce and his wife, the 
former Margery Ellison "Marnie" Walker of Columbia, are establishing the R. Roy and Margery W. Pearce Center for Professional 
Communication - a Class of 1941 initiative - with a $1.5 million 
commitment to the University. Their generous gift is the largest 
cash gift in the University's history. 
Dr. Pearce, who is president of the Class of 1941 and a past 
president of the Clemson Alumni Association, also heads that 
class's drive to raise a minimum of $5 million for Clemson in memory of classmates who died in World War II. Dr. and Mrs. Pearce's 
gift will help complete that goal by the class's Golden Anniversary 
Reunion in 1991. 
Dr. Pearce was one of the quarterbacks on the 1939 Clemson 
football squad that played in the Cotton Bowl. He also played on 
Coach Frank Howard's first team as head coach that won the 
Southern Conference championship in 1940. 
Dr. Pearce is president of Roy Pearce Associates, management 
counselors, and secretary of Budweiser of Columbia, Inc.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 8
The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows : 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread ; other degrees wear black or discipl ine colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
- indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a " V" ). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
''the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
