HONORARY DEGREE 
MARLIN DON LOGAN 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Clemson alumnus Don Logan is President of Time Inc., whose 1992 sales of $3.1 
billion make it the largest magazine publisher in the world and one of the largest book 
publishers. 
As President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Logan oversees the operations of 
the wholly owned publishing arm of the media and entertainment conglomerate, Time 
Warner Inc. The parent corporation had 1992 sales of $13.1 billion, ranking third in the 
Fortune Service 500 list of the largest 100 diversified service companies. 
Time Inc. publishes Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Money, People, Entertainment Weekly, Sports Illustrated for Kids, Parenting, Health, Martha Stewart Living, 
Vibe and Sunset. Time lnc.'s other book publishing operations range from Time Life 
Inc. and Book-of-the-Month Club to Warner Books and Little, Brown & Co. 
Mr. Logan was tapped as President of Time Inc. after an outstanding 22-year 
career with its Southern Progress unit based in Birmingham. Southern Progress Corporation is the largest regional magazine and book publishing company in the country 
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Inc. It publishes Southern Living, Progressive 
Farmer, Cooking Light, Southern Accents and Travel South magazines, as well as Oxmoor House books. 
He joined Southern Progress as a data processing manager in 1970 and had risen 
to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer when Time Inc. brought him to New York City 
last year. Under Mr. Logan's leadership, Southern Progress has enjoyed some of the 
highest profit margins in the magazine and book~ publishing industries. 
Since moving to New York, he has maintained his Southern and civil rights connections, continuing to serve as Co-chair of the Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham 
and as a board member of the Alabama Association of Independent Colleges. He also 
is a member of the Board of Directors of the Magazine Publishers of America. 
Mr. Logan has developed many ties to Clemson University through the years. He 
earned his Master of Science degree here in 1968 and worked on his Ph.D. degree 
in mathematics at Clemson for one semester. Today he serves as a member of the 
President's Advisory Council. 
An Alabama native, Mr. Logan earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics 
at Auburn University, graduating magna cum laude in 1966. 
Clemson University considers it a special privilege to honor one of its own whose 
achievements in the corporate business world have brought great credit to himself, his 
family and to his alma mater. We hold Don Logan's accomplishments in the highest 
regard, and it is a pleasure to award him the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Educa1ion, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
Its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 9
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical State1nent 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "colleg_e prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does exte~sive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
