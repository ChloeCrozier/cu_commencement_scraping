HONORARY DEGREE 
M. DAVID EGAN 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Clemson University Professor Emeritus M. David Egan is a distinguished educator, 
lecturer, author and consultant. Born in Trenton, New Jersey, he earned his undergraduate 
degree from Lafayette College in 1962 and his master's degree from Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology in 1966. From 1962 to 1964, he served as a U.S. Army officer commanding 
Ordnance troops in the Foret de Trois-Fontaines, France. 
In 1972, Professor Egan joined Clemson's faculty in the School of Design and Building. 
Because of his dedication, expertise and professionalism in the classroom and consulting, 
he gained the reputation for being a leader. For more than 30 years, Professor Egan has 
excelled as an educator in the areas of architectural acoustics, lighting, fire and life safety, 
and low-energy design. He has authored six major textbooks and several sections in 
reference books for architects and engineers. His textbooks are not only a part of Clemson's 
curriculum but also curricula of more than 200 schools worldwide. 
Professor Egan's service to Clemson University has placed him in high regard among 
his professional and collegiate peers and has brought credit and recognition to the 
University and the School of Design and Building. Principally through his teaching, 
writing and consulting on acoustics, his contributions to education and architecture are 
universally recognized. 
His numerous awards include advancement to Fellowship in the Acoustical Society of 
America, election as vice president of the National Council of Acoustical Consultants, 
board certification by the Institute of Noise Control Engineering, honorary membership in 
the American Institute of Architects and recognition as Lifetime Distinguished Professor 
of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. 
A testament of Professor Egan's dedication to public service and justice is the story of 
his untiring efforts to obtain recognition for three forgotten heroes of the Vietnam War. It 
took nine years, but Professor Egan's remarkable leadership, determination and 
resourcefulness brought the effort to a successful conclusion. On March 6, 1998, 30 years 
after the shameful massacre at My Lai, the U.S. Army awarded Soldier's Medals to Hugh 
C. Thompson Jr., Lawrence M. Colburn and Glenn U. Andreotta (posthumously) for their 
intervention to save lives of defenseless civilians and end the massacre. 
Professor Egan embodies those ideals that Clemson University values. His wide 
recognition and respect as a humanitarian, an author and an educator place him in a 
unique position to represent Clemson and its mission to audiences throughout the world. 
Clemson University holds. Professor Emeritus Martin David Egan and his lifetime 
achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the 
presentation of the Doctor of Laws.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as fo llows:

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma llest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown . 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining spec ifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "Y"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 21
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. t\.obert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington {1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, 
Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for 
Management Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors 
of Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, 
and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.

Note: Candidates appearing in this program are not certified graduates. Likewise, 
academic honors designations are based upon performance prior to final grades. Both 
certification of graduation and honors designations must come from the Registrar of 
the University.
