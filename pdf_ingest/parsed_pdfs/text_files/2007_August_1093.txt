HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who lefr the 
bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School 
of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; 
however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern 
planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published 
numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in 
founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a political 
figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. 
Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. 
The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemenred by 
two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic units. 
These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the 
College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human 
Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be directed 
to Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 1866 
Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is also 
available at sacscoc.org. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, American Society of 
Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and Design, 
National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPA/AALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American Foresters. 
Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-gram institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five agricultural 
experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily committed to a 
varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with 
the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecrure, Arts. and 
Humanities

Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval 
origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes 
specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually monar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black 
or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer 
than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves 
extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and 
the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to 
replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
A ll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy 
(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations chat are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presencly the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, nuscees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as sec forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped 
in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three 
velvet bars piped in gold for doci.oraces and an embroidered palmetto ttee on t:ach sleeve for chose who do not 
hold doctorates. Hoods are either from C lemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the 
U niversity Marshal. C lad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the 
U niversity mace. Ac the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 7
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The Universiry mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
Universiry and must be present at any convocation where the Universiry, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the Universiry Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout 
the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is 
symbolic of the official withdrawal of the Universiry and, thus, the close of the 
proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces 
carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, 
however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the Universiry in gold and the Universiry 
colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is 
also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authoriry vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the Universiry. Only the Universiry President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The barons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" 
which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They 
display the seal of the Universiry and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the 
college belongs. Clemson's barons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. 
Wilson of Clemson University.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGaricy/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old C lemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
