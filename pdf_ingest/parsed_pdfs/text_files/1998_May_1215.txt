HONORARY DEGREE 
MILTON WINFORD HOLCOMBE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Milton Winford Holcombe is a man known for his stellar contributions to the field of 
engineering. Described by many as perceptive, personable and of the highest moral fiber, 
he is also a faithfu l alumnus of Clemson University. 
A native of Central, Mr. Holcombe graduated from Clemson in 1953 with a B.S. in 
Electrical Engineering. For the first few years after graduation, he worked for the 
Tennessee Valley Authority and served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps. 
From 1956 to 1970, he held electrical engineering positions with Lockheed Aircraft 
Corporation, Electronic Communications, Inc., and Collins Radio Company. In these 
positions, he contributed to the design of antenna systems, and he was responsible for 
electronic systems design, integration and installation for airborne platforms and ground 
stations. 
In 1970 Mr. Holcombe was one of four founders of Electrospace Systems, Inc., which 
quickly grew from a start-up to a major corporation with annual sales approaching $200 
million. Among his many contributions as vice president, Mr. Holcombe was responsible 
for the creation of the U.S. Airborne Command Post, the aircraft built for the use of the 
President of the United States and Joint Chiefs of Staff during an international crisis. In 
1987 Electrospace Systems was bought by Chrysler Corporation, and Mr. Holcombe 
remained for three years as president of Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems. 
During his career, he has earned a number of honors including selection for Who's Who 
in Texas, Who's Who in Technology Today and Who's Who in Aerospace and Aviation. 
Mr. Holcombe was named Engineer of the Year in 1982 by the Texas Society of 
Professional Engineers. His alma mater honored him with the Distinguished Service 
Award in 1988 and in 1990, with the Clemson Medallion. 
Mr. Holcombe has been involved in a number of professional and civic organizations 
including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), American 
Electronics Association, and American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He has 
served on the board of the Northern Trust Bank of Dallas, the board for Stanford 
Telecommunications and is active at the Richardson Heights Baptist Church. In addition, 
Mr. Holcombe is a private pilot and a member of the International Commanche 
Association. 
Mr. Holcombe is a former member of the Clemson University Foundation Board, 
Clemson's Electrical and Computer Engineering Industrial Advisory Board, and the 
College of Engineering and Science Industrial Advisory Board. His generous gift to 
Clemson in 1987 created the Milton W. and Betty M. Holcombe Endowed Chair of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
He and his wife, Betty, have been married for almost 42 years and are parents of twin 
daughters, Karen H. Leftwich and Kathryn H. Wheeler. The Holcombes have a ranch 
south of Waco, Texas, where purebred Simmental cattle are raised. 
We hold Milton Winford Holcombe and his achievements in the highest esteem. In 
recognition of his significant contributions to electrical engineering, our country and 
Clemson University, it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the presentation of the 
honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

HONORARY DEGREE 
WALTER GAMEWELL WATSON 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
A true figure of kindness and a loyal friend of Clemson, Walter Gamewell Watson is a 
man whose exceptional contributions to the practice of medicine and the lives of those in 
his care have earned notable recognition. 
A native of Trenton, South Carolina, Dr. Watson graduated from The Citadel in 1931 
with a B.S. in Chemistry. A football fan from the start, he coached high school football in 
Edgefield, South Carolina, and Bainbridge, Georgia, while saving money for medical 
school. In 1943, he graduated from the Medical College of Georgia. After medical school, 
Dr. Watson served in Korea in the U.S. Army 6th Infantry Division as Captain from 1945 
to 1947. 
When he returned in 1947, Dr. Watson began his career in the obstetrics and 
gynecology program at the University Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, and served as chair of 
the department for most of his outstanding 50-year career. During his service at University 
Hospital, Dr. Watson delivered more than 15,000 babies and taught countless medical 
students. In honor of his dedication to medicine and the many he has touched, the new 
University Hospital Women's Center was named for Dr. Watson in November 1997. 
Dr. Watson has been recognized with many honors during his long career. In 1988 he 
received the S.C. American Legion Award. In 1990, the U.S. House of Representatives 
recognized him for meritorious service to mankind. The same year, he was awarded the 
Congressional Record recognition of service. Dr. Watson was honored still further in 1998 
when he received the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest praise. 
An example of humanitarian service, Dr. Watson devoted 50 years of care to the North 
Augusta High School athletic program, providing physicals for athletes and tending the 
injured. He has also been active in Grace Methodist Church in a number of leadership 
capacities. 
Dr. Watson and his wife, Audrey, live in North Augusta, South Carolina. They have 
raised five children, Donah, Ben, Kathy, Betsy and Mary, all of whom live nearby in South 
Carolina and Georgia. Though he no longer practices obstetrics, Dr. Watson remains 
chairman of the Ob-Gyn Department at University Hospital, and his gynecological 
practice continues. 
Although he is not an alumnus, his connection to Clemson has remained strong during 
his life. His father attended Clemson, as did two of Dr. Watson's children, Ben and Mary. 
Three of his grandchildren, Patrick, Jamie and Matthew Watson, are current students. 
We are all extremely proud of the significant contributions this great man and 
humanitarian has made to medicine, this nation and the people in his care. In recognition 
of his devotion to mankind and his life of service, it is a distinct privilege to honor Walter 
Gamewell Watson with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts and

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty fo llow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions a re 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tasse ls 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. O lder gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three ve lvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat ( charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on 
Accreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of 
Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
