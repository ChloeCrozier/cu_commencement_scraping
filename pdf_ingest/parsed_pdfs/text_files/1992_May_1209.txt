HONORARY DEGREE 
PAUL EUGENE BLACKWELL 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Paul Eugene Blackwell, who finished Clemson as a distinguished military graduate 
twenty-nine years ago, has risen to the rank of Brigadier General of the Army during 
an outstanding career which included a key command role in Operation Desert Shield 
and Desert Storm. 
A native South Carol inian born in York, General Blackwell has a long association 
with Clemson University, including a stint on the faculty of the Mil itary Science 
Department as Assistant Professor of Military Science (1970-73). For this he won 
national honors as an outstanding ROTC instructor. 
During the Persian Gulf War, General Blackwell was a commander of the 3rd Armored Division which led the attack of the coalition forces into Iraq. He was decorated 
for exemplary actions which were vital to the division during deployment from Europe, 
preparation for war, and victory over the Iraqi Republican Guard Corps. Last September he was the University's guest of honor at the homecoming game where all of 
America's Desert Storm soldiers were honored. 
His student career at Clemson began in 1959 when he enrolled as an undergraduate after graduating with honor at York High School. He majored in Agricultural 
Education at Clemson while completing the Reserve Officers' Training Corps curriculum. General Blackwell was awarded the Bachelor of Science degree with honors 
(1963) and was a distinguished military graduate, receiving his commission as a 
Second Lieutenant of Infantry. He remained at Clemson for two more years to earn 
his Master of Science degree in Horticulture and Agricultural Education (1965). He 
also has completed a number of important mi litary education courses and schools, 
culminating in graduation from the Army War College (1983). 
General Blackwell has held a wide variety of command and staff positions which 
have taken him to many states and foreign countries. Prior to his assignment in the 
Persian Gulf, he held a variety of important career-building assignments in the United 
States, Vietnam, and Germany. His present assignment is at Garlstedt, Federal Republic of Germany, as Commanding General of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) and 
Commander, Bremerhaven Military Community. He will be promoted to Major General 
in June and assume command of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Stewart, 
Georgia. 
His many decorations include the Silver Star with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the 
Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with " V" Device and eight 
Oak Leaf Clusters, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the 
Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Medal with three Oak 
Leaf Clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with "V" Device and three Oak Leaf 
Clusters, the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal -and 
numerous foreign decorations for gallantry. 
He is married to the former Janet Glenn of York, and they have one son, Paul 
Eugene, Jr. 
General Blackwell's contributions to the defense of his country and the achievements in his profession have brought great credit upon him and to his alma mater 
and are held in the highest regard by his fellow alumni and all South Carolinians. It 
is a privilege to honor him with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of 
Laws.

The President's Award 
PAGE MORTON HUNTER SALLY ABNEY ROSE 
PAGE MORTON HUNTER 
Mrs. Page Morton Hunter's lifelong caree.r of individual volunteerism and public 
service reflects significant personal commitment to the advancement of education and 
to the improvement of the human community. 
After earning degrees from Mercer and Emory universities, the Gray, Georgia, 
native advanced the Allied Cause during World War II by helping to establish libraries 
at United States Army and Air Force installations across the country. In 1943 she became chief of libraries for the Third United States Air Force. 
Following the war, Mrs. Hunter lived in New York City, where she was involved in 
extensive volunteer work for her church and community and for the fledgling United 
Nations. She would meet arriving UN-delegation staff members from around the world 
and help them settle into their new surroundings. 
By 1973, Mrs. Hunter had returned to the South and become assistant director of 
the Athens, Georgia, Regional Library. It was during this period that she married the 
late Thomas Mitchell Hunter, a 1909 Clemson graduate and a distinguished engineer 
and inventor. Together the Hunters shared a suite at the Clemson House and great 
love for Clemson University. Evidence of this love includes The Hunter Endowed Chair 
of Bioengineering, The Hunter Honors Lecture Series, and The Page Morton Hunter 
Engineering Fellowship. 
Clemson is honored to count among its special friends Page Morton Hunter and, 
in recognition thereof, proudly presents to her The President's Award. 
SALLY ABNEY ROSE 
Mrs. Sally Abney Rose, daughter of the late John Pope and Susie Mathews Abney, 
has been a trustee of The Abney Foundation since it was founded by her mother in 
1957 and is the only surviving member of its original board. For several years she has 
been a Clemson neighbor, residing on the Clemson Highway near Anderson, and a 
supporter of numerous activities of the Clemson community. 
While Mrs. Rose is not a Clemson alumna (Converse College in Spartanburg has 
that honor), Clemson is proud to claim her as a member of our University family. As 
evidenced by her work with The Abney Foundation, one of Mrs. Rose's chief areas of 
interests is higher education. Clemson has been - and is - a primary beneficiary of 
this interest. With her wholehearted support, The Abney Foundation established The 
Abney Foundation Scholarship Fund at Clemson, with a total contribution to date of 
$1.45 million, and in 1981 the Foundation donated $1 million to the University to 
establish the Abney Chair of Free Enterprise. 
Mrs. Rose's interests have not been entirely focused on Clemson. Her benevolence also has benefited her alma mater and many other schools at which The Abney 
Foundation provides scholarships. Further, many agencies in the health field, another 
of her prime interests, are indebted to her as well. 
In appreciation for her widespread interests and in particular her interest in 
Clemson, the University is honored to bestow The President's Award upon Sally Abney 
Rose.

FRANK J. WIDEMAN, JR. 
FRANK J. WIDEMAN, JR. 
For more than two decades, Frank J. Wideman, Jr. has provided leadership in 
charitable causes and higher education throughout the Palmetto State. This is reflected 
by his active involvement in numerous civic endeavors and his distinguished tenure as 
Executive Vice President of The Self Foundation, long noted for its support of projects 
that advance the quality of life in South Carolina, particularly in the areas of higher 
education and health care. 
Mr. Wideman, a Floridian by birth, graduated from Episcopal High School in 
Virginia. He has a bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina and a law 
degree from the University of Florida. 
Upon returning from World War II as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine 
Corps, Mr. Wideman practiced law in Florida and the District of Columbia for 18 years. 
In 1969, he moved to his ancestral home near Bradley, South Carol ina, and became a 
trust officer of South Carolina National Bank, serving Anderson, Greenwood and Aiken. 
Clemson has benefited greatly from Mr. Wideman's advice and assistance over 
the years. Most recently, he was instrumental in The Self Foundation's gifts for The 
Clemson University Student Center and The Multiuser Biotechnology Facil ity. 
For all he has done to improve the lives of South Carolinians and for his service 
to this university, Clemson presents with pleasure the 1992 President's Award to 
Frank J. Wideman, Jr.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
Its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 11
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson Is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultur-al experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
