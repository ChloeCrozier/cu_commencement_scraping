HONORARY DEGREE 
WILLIAM WALTER DUKES, JR. 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
William Walter Dukes, Jr. is known to friends and family as one of the most unselfish, 
honorable and truly good people you could hope to find. He is also known by many as a 
savvy businessman, an individual deeply interested in the well-being of our communities 
and the state of South Carolina, and an ardent supporter of Clemson. 
Mr. Dukes began his career at the Charleston Naval Yard after graduating from 
Clemson at the top of his engineering class in 1938 with a B.S. in Electrical 
Engineering. One year later, he began work at General Electric as an engineer, where he 
worked for two years until World War II. 
In July 1941, Mr. Dukes was called to active duty in the U.S. Army. He served for five 
years, earning the Commendation Medal for Outstanding Service. He remained in the 
active reserves for 22 years before retiring as a Colonel. 
After World War II, he co-founded Applied Engineering Company, Inc. in 
Orangeburg. The company became a leader in designing and manufacturing peak 
shaving plants for natural gas utilities as well as modular process systems for the 
chemical, petroleum and pharmaceutical industries. 
Mr. Dukes remained as Vice President and President after the company was acquired 
by Daniel Construction in 1969 until retiring from Fluor Daniel in 1983. His professiona l 
associations include membership in the American Gas Association, National Society of 
Professional Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Eng ineers, American Institute 
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and South Carolina Forestry Association. 
An example of service and loyalty, Mr. Dukes has contributed to organizations on 
national, regional and community levels. He has served on a number of boards including 
the First Federal S&L of Orangeburg, First Savings Bank of Greenville, American Red 
Cross, United Way of Orangeburg, Orangeburg Technical College Foundation, Elk's 
Club, Still Hopes Home for the Aging, Diocese of South Carolina and Orangeburg's 
Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. An ardent proponent of education, he has also served 
on the Board of Trustees of Voorhees College and St. Mary's College. 
Throughout his successful career, Mr. Dukes' devotion to Clemson University has been 
unwavering. Following retirement, he and his wife, Peggy, have freely given their time 
and energy to the University. Mr. Dukes received the Alumni Distinguished Service 
Award in 1979 and served as President of the University Foundation in 1985-1986. Today 
he continues this service as an Honorary Director of the Foundation. Also a generous 
C lemson Fund supporter, Mr. Dukes has established the William W. Dukes, Jr. 
Endowment for Engineering Excellence and is a member of the Thomas Green Clemson 
Society. 
We hold Bill Dukes and his lifetime achievements in the highest esteem. In 
recognition of his contributions to engineering and his community, and his remarkable 
life of service to Clem on University, it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the 
presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

HONORARY DEGREE 
LAURIE COKE LAWSON 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
A man whose exceptional contributions to farming and agriculture earn national 
recognition, and a true Southern gentleman known for his honest nature and concern for 
others, Laurie Coke Lawson is a faithful son of Clemson. 
Mr. Lawson came to Clemson from St. John's High School in Darlington. An agronomy 
major, he graduated with a B.S. in 1953. Following graduation, Mr. Lawson served as a 
Division Ammunition Officer for the 69th Infantry Division as a First Lieutenant. 
Since his return to Darlington in 1955, Mr. Lawson has been actively engaged in 
farming . With two of his sons, he owns and operates a diversified farming operation that 
produces crops including tobacco, cotton, corn, soybeans, sweet potatoes, wheat and timber. 
Called Lawson Farms, this family farm was established in 1834 by his great-grandfather. 
Mr. Lawson has served as State Executive Director for the Farm Service Agency, U .S. 
Department of Agriculture since 1993. From 1979 to 1986 he was appointed by Governor 
Richard W. Riley to serve as Chairman of the S.C. Agriculture Commission. 
Among Mr. Lawson's professional honors and awards, in 1982 he was named as one of 10 
outstanding farmers in the United States by American Cyanamid Corporation. He 
received the Award of Recognition for his contribution to South Carolina agriculture in 
1983, Progressive Farmer Man of the Year Award in 1985 and S.C. Farm Bureau's 
Distinguished Service Award in 1986. In 1987 Mr. Lawson was recognized further for his 
outstanding contributions to agricu lture when he was awarded the Order of the Palmetto, 
South Carolina's highest honor, by Governor Riley. 
Service to his church and to his community has always been a priority for Mr. Lawson. 
He is actively involved with Trinity United Methodist Church in Darlington, where he is 
Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Chairman of the Building Committee and Sunday 
School teacher. He has served as Chairman of the Epworth Children's Home Board of 
Trustees and is now serving a new eight-year term on this board. Service on a number of 
local and regional leadership boards includes the S.C. Farm Bureau Federation, Darlington 
County Farm Bureau, Kiwanis Club, NationsBank Advisory Board of Darlington and 
Darlington County School Board. 
C lemson University has remained a focus of Mr. Lawson's support and devotion. He was 
recognized by the S.C. County Agents Association for his outstanding contribution to 
agriculture and C lemson University Extension Service in 1982. ln 1983 he was made an 
alumnus member of Clemson's Gamma Sigma Delta, the international honor society of 
ag ricu lture, and was given a distinguished service award. He served as C lemson's delegate 
to the Commission on Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching from 1979 to 1993. 
A member of the Board of Directors of Clemson Agriculture Alumni since 1990, he served 
as President in 1996 and 1997. The C lemson Board of Visitors has benefited from his 
insight and experience since 1991. 
He is married to the former Elizabeth Banks Pearce, his wife of over 44 years. They have 
four children, Marvin, Elizabeth, William and James, and eight grandchildren. 
We are all extremely proud of the significant contributions Mr. Lawson has made to the 
field of agricu lture, the state of South Carolina, and Clemson University. We hold Laurie 
Lawson and his achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor 
him with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the banner bearers are the college marshals and faculty. Each banner is a 
combination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which 
were established by the American Council on Education, arc as follows: 
College

Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions a re 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps a re 
black and are usually mortar boards with tasse ls. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma llest, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award 
hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph .D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is presently the on ly 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military 
regalia as set forth by their professions. They arc preceded by the University Marshal. C lad 
in a gown of office in go ld and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the facu lty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

+Departmental Honors: The graduates so designated have completed an enriched program of study designed by their 
departments with the approval of the Calhoun College Honors Program. To earn Departmental Honors students must 
complete an honors thesis and/or other upper division honors courses, while maintaining an overall grade-point ratio of 
3.40 or higher. Departmental Honors graduates appear in the line of march wearing the Calhoun College Honors 
Medallion on an orallge and purple ribbon. This medallion is made possible by an endowment established by Mrs. 
Katherine Inabinet Vickery of Columbia, South Carolina, to honor the memory of her husband and Clemson graduate, 
the late B. C. Inabinet. 
Students wearing the white stoles over their gowns are members of honorary societies that require a minimum 3.00 
grade point ratio for membership. The stoles have the University seal embroidered on one side, and on the other side 
are the emblem(s) of honorary societies in which the student is a member.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of C lemson's mace is derived from the ceremonia l 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on 
Accreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National 
Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of 
Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
