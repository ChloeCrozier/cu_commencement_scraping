HONORARY DEGREE 
THOMAS FRANKLIN KELLER 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Dr. Thomas F. Keller, teacher, author, university administrator and native 
South Carolinian, is dean of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. 
He also serves as chairman of the Department of Management Science and as 
R. J. Reynolds Industries Professor of Business Administration. 
Dr. Keller was named to his current positions in 1974 and has been the 
principal architect of the business school's impressive growth and development. 
In the fall of 1985 corporate recruiters ranked the M.B.A. program of the Fuqua 
School of Business among the nation's top ten. 
His success story with the Fuqua School of Business was the subject of a 
feature story in The Wall Street Journal on May 13, 1986. The newspaper said 
that the business school was "lost in a pack of also-rans" when Dr. Keller became dean. The school only had a handful of students, a small endowment and 
no building of its own. 
From the beginning, Dr. Keller was determined to run the school like a 
business, thinking in terms of products and markets. The Journal said that the 
way in which Duke's business school went so far so fast is a textbook example 
of shrewd promotion by its dean. His strategy included the assembling of a fasttrack faculty to enhance the image of the school and formation of a Board of 
Visitors from Fortune 500 companies, potential donors and employers of M.B.A.s. 
Last year the school had eight endowed chairs at $1 million each, up from 
five in 1980. Enrollment of full-time students in the daytime M.B.A. program had 
nearly doubled to 457 since 1980. 
A certified public accountant, Dr. Keller is widely respected as an author 
of contributions to numerous journals, as editor of The Accounting Review, and 
as coauthor of textbooks used extensively in intermediate accounting, financial 
accounting theory and advanced accounting. 
Dr. Keller is a native of Greenwood and a Duke alumnus, having earned his 
A.B. degree in 1953. He also has an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. from the University of 
Michigan. He taught at the University of Michigan prior to joining the Duke 
University faculty in 1959 as an assistant professor. He served as vice provost 
of Duke during 1971-72. 
Clemson University holds him and his achievements in the highest regard. 
It is a special privilege for all of us to honor him in this way.

HONORARY DEGREE 
JOHN CHARLES LINDSAY 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Senator John C. Lindsay has served in the General Assembly of the State of 
South Carolina for the past thirty-four years, and today is one of the most effective and influential members of the State Senate, ranking fourth in seniority. 
Since 1963 he has been a member of the Senate, representing Senatorial 
District No. 28 which comprises Dillon, Marlboro and Chesterfield counties. He 
previously served as a member of the House of Representatives for nine years 
prior to his election to the Senate. 
Senator Lindsay, who resides in his native Bennettsville, is a Marine combat 
veteran of World War II. He earned his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1951 at the 
University of South Carolina School of Law and is an attorney with the firm of 
Lindsay and Lindsay. As a lawyer, he has earned the respect of his peers and 
has distinguished himself as an effective advocate of equal justice for all under 
the law. 
In the legislature, Senator Lindsay has been an advocate of full-formula 
funding for institutions of higher learning in the State. He has led and supported 
the fight to improve educational opportunities for our children, to provide for our 
elderly and to assist our farmers. In the past few years he has been instrumental 
in securing the necessary funding to enable the Industrial Commission to expedite consideration of employee claims. 
He was instrumental in the passage of legislation to create the Office of 
Consumer Affairs in the State and to provide funds and legislation for the State 
Housing Authority to make housing available to moderate and low-income citizens. 
He serves as chairman of the Banking and Insurance Committee and second 
vice chairman of the Finance Committee. He also is chairman of the Senate 
Study Committee for Consumer Affairs and is an ex officio member of the State 
Housing Authority. Senator Lindsay is widely acknowledged as a witty and 
eloquent speaker with a keen intellect. A common theme which runs through 
his public life is his tireless and unselfish efforts on behalf of the working people and the less privileged. 
It is a special privilege to honor this distinguished public servant, good 
friend of Clemson University, and one who has done so much to help South 
Carolinians enjoy a better quality of life. We express our most sincere appreciation to Senator Lindsay for all that his legislative career has meant to our state.

COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER 
DR. HAROLD N. COOLEDGE, JR. 
Dr. Harold N. Cooledge, Jr., is Alumni Professor of Art and Architectural 
History at Clemson University. 
Dr. Cooledge, who joined the Clemson faculty in 1957, was born in Atlanta. 
He earned a Bachelor of Science degree (1944) in chemistry from Harvard College and worked as a government research chemist both in the U. S. and overseas during World War II. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree (1949) 
from Harvard University Graduate School of Design and an M.A. degree (1956) 
and a Ph.D. degree (1962), both from the University of Pennsylvania. 
Dr. Cooledge, who has travelled extensively in Europe and the Far East, has 
published many articles and books on mid-19th century architecture in America 
and architecture of Portugal. He has extensive experience in historic preservation 
and restoration and served for many years on the State Board of Review (S. C. 
Department of Archives & History) for nominations to the National Register. 
He has announced plans to retire at the end of the spring semester, bringing 
to a close a long and distinguished academic career with Clemson. Dr. Cooledge 
plans to devote considerable time to the development of additional publications 
and also will serve as a lecturer in continuing education programs overseas for 
Georgia Tech.

The President's Award 
MILTON W. HOLCOMBE 
Milton W. Holcombe, a 1953 graduate in electrical and computer engineering, 
is a testimony to the great significance of hard work in the field of high technology and generous service to higher education. Holcombe is the co-founder 
and vice president of Electrospace Systems Inc., an electronics firm based in 
Richardson, Texas that, in less than 20 years, has grown into a multi-million 
dollar telecommunications and navigation systems business. 
On December 16, President Lennon announced with pride that Holcombe had 
presented the university with a significant gift that will endow a chair in the 
department of electrical and computer engineering. Holcombe serves on the 
Electrical and Computer Engineering Advisory Board at Clemson. He is a native 
of Central and his wife, Betty Jo Morgan Holcombe, is from Clemson. She is a 
1956 graduate of Winthrop College. They live in Richardson and have twin 
daughters Kathryn and Karen. 
PHILIP H. PRINCE 
Few Clemson graduates have had more distinguished careers 'or longer 
records of service to this institution than Philip H. Prince, class of 1949. He has 
served not only as President of the Alumni Association and IPTAY, but will begin 
his term next year as President of the Clemson University Foundation. This devotion to his alma mater has been constant throughout a career that has taken 
him from Milliken and Company in Spartanburg to the Manhattan offices of American Express, where he was senior vice president for personnel until 1983. The day 
Phil Prince returned to South Carolina was a great one for Clemson. Today, he 
lives and works at Pawleys Island and continues to give generously of his time, 
talent and energy to the cause of a better Clemson University. 
JOSEPH A. SHIRLEY 
Joseph A. Shirley, a 1940 Clemson graduate, has a long history of significant 
service to education, particularly to his alma mater. In 1981, he and other descendants of Callie Jones Shirley, his mother, established an endowment in her 
memory to benefit Clemson's Robert Muldrow Cooper Library. Because of his 
leadership and encouragement, that endowment has grown steadily over the 
years, becoming the library's largest source of private support. The Shirley 
Endowment stands as a lasting legacy to Joseph A. Shirley's loyal, generous and 
much appreciated support for higher education at Clemson University and to the 
love of learning that Callie Jones Shirley instilled in her descendants.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation- Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
