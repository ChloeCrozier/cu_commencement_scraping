HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
WALTER ANDERSON 
Walter Anderson, honored many times with awards for editorial excellence and 
humanitarian service, is editor of Parade, the popular Sunday newspaper magazine, 
and a senior vice president of Parade Publications, Inc. 
Anderson, a respected journalist and author, has seen Parade magazine's circulation grow from 21.6 million in 129 Sunday newspapers to more than 35 million copies 
in 333 newspapers during his 1 O years as editor. 
Once a high school dropout, Anderson is a national spokesman for GED, the program which enables high school dropouts to gain their equivalency diplomas. He also 
is a director of the national Dropout Prevention Fund . 
Anderson joined Parade Publications as a senior editor of Parade in 1977, was 
named managing editor in 1978 and editor in 1980. Prior to joining Parade, Anderson 
held several top management and editorial positions with Gannett Newspapers in 
New York State. 
He is a member of the National Advisory Board of Literacy Volunteers of America, 
and his latest book, "Read With Me," will be published by Houghton Mifflin on September 8, International Literacy Day. First Lady Barbara Bush chairs the LVA advisory 
board, and this year, Anderson received the organization's Stars in Literacy Award 
along with Mrs. Bush and Wally "Famous" Amos. He also is a member of the board of 
advisors of the National Center for Family Literacy. 
His first book, "Courage Is a Three-Letter Word," was published in hard-cover in 
June 1986 by Random House and in paperback in July 1987 by Fawcett Crest. Jack 
Anderson called the book, "a moving and inspiring tribute to the indomitability of the 
human spirit, most strongly embodied in Walter Anderson himself." 
Anderson's second book, "The Greatest Risk of All," was published in 1988. The 
Kirkus Reviews described Anderson as "the Dale Carnegie of the 80's." Margaret 
Truman called the book " richly inspiring ," and Alex Haley said it "vividly illustrates 
that it is those people who dare who will succeed." 
In March 1988, Anderson was honored for his professional leadership and humanitarian service with the Tree of Life Award from the Jewish National Fund. Proceeds 
from the ceremony, where the award was presented by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie 
Wiesel, were used to establish the Walter Anderson Forest in Israel. In September of 
the same year, he received the Spirit of America Award from the Institute for the Study 
of American Wars, an educational research organization which honors veterans of 
foreign wars for their humanitarian service. Last year, he received the Napoleon Hill 
Foundation Gold Medal for literary achievement. 
A summa cum laude graduate of Mercy College where he majored in psychology, 
Anderson was valedictorian of his class . He also was valedictorian of his class at 
Westchester Community College where he received an associate of arts degree. He 
served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Mercy College for eight years and is 
now trustee emeritus. 
Clemson University holds him and his achievements in the highest regard, and it 
is a privilege to present Walter Anderson with the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

HONORARY DEGREE 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
JOHN D. ARCHBOLD 
John D. Archbold has had a distinguished career as an engineer, inventor, philanthropist, and conservationist. He has been awarded many honors, both national and 
international, during his remarkable lifetime. 
An avid sailor, adventurer, and world traveller, he has developed a strong interest 
in the preservation of tropical ecosystems and tropical cultures and has devoted much 
of his energy to these efforts in recent years. 
In May 1989, Mr. Archbold donated his beloved Springfield Plantation on the Caribbean island of Dominica to Clemson University. Springfield Plantation consists of 200 
acres and nearly 30,000 square feet of lodging and storage space. 
This generous gift formed the basis for the newly created Archbold Tropical 
Research Center, a consortium of 10 universities and agencies dedicated to research 
and education concerning tropical ecosystems. Mr. Archbold's gift is helping Clemson 
move to the forefront in the study of global environmental problems. 
Mr. Archbold, who serves as honorary chairman of the consortium board, was 
born in the picturesque port town of Bar Harbor, Maine, son of an Irishman and the 
grandson of the first chief executive officer of Standard Oil of New Jersey. As a youngster he attended the Choate School in Connacticut, going on to study mechanical 
engineering at the University of Geneva and at Princeton University. He invented and 
patented a rotary internal combustion engine. 
Mr. Archbold first came upon Dominica in 1935 while searching for a priceless 
Colombian treasure at sea. He was twenty-four years of age and decided to enter 
Dominica's planter business primarily as a producer of citrus. He bought land on the 
island, where he developed a plantation and hotel complex. 
A large area of the plantation, Middleham Estates, was maintained as a pristine 
tropical rain forest. In 1975 he donated approximately 1,000 acres of this land to the 
Nature Conservancy. This land, now known as the Archbold Preserve, contributed to 
the establishment and expansion of the Morne Trois Pitons National Park on Dominica, 
one of the very few misty forest preserves in the Caribbean. 
Because of these accomplishments, Mr. Archbold was awarded the Order of the 
British Empire. He also received the SISSEROU Award, the highest order given by the 
Government of Dominica to a private citizen for distinguished public service in agriculture. 
Mr. Archbold's interest in Dominica and tropical ecology led him to support many 
years of research on the flora and fauna of the island by the Smithsonian Institution. 
This has led to the publication of more than 60 scientific works totaling more than 
1,500 published pages. 
Members of the new consortium are Clemson, the University of the West Indies, 
Medical University of South Carolina, University of Georgia, Texas A&M University, 
Syracuse University/SUNY-ESF, Yale University, U.S. Forest Service, National Park 
Service, and the Smithsonian Institution. 
Given his career of philanthropy, his dedication to the promotion of research and 
education, his long involvement in conservation, and the high honors of recognition 
bestowed upon him by foreign governments, the awarding of an honorary Doctor of 
Laws degree from Clemson University is a most appropriate and timely action.

The President's Award 
JAMES G. BANNON, JR. JENNINGS G. McABEE 
JAMES G. BANNON, JR. 
James G. Bannon, Jr.'s sincere interest in Clemson University and his generous 
service as a donor and volunteer leader place him among this institution's most 
appreciated supporters. 
Mr. Bannon, a 1965 graduate, and his wife, DeeGee, live in Arlington, Texas, where 
he is vice president of Azon Corporation. Their roots, however, are in South Carolina, 
for both are Greenville natives and have families here in the Upstate. Their son, James 
G. "Trey" Bannon, Ill, is a 1989 Clemson graduate. 
The Bannons are benefactors of the Jim and DeeGee Bannon Scholarship Endowment, having personally committed $100,000 to generate unrestricted scholarships for 
Clemson students. As major donors to the University's academic program, the Bannons are members of the prestigious Benjamin Ryan Tillman Society. 
Mr. Bannon also gives generously of his time and experience, serving as a director 
of the Clemson University Foundation, which raises, receives and invests private gifts 
for the benefit of Clemson's academic mission. 
Separate from his personal contributions to the University, he is a new trustee of the 
Bannon Foundation, which also provides scholarship support for Clemson students. 
Clemson University is proud of Jim Bannon's leadership in helping to prepare his 
alma mater for the 21st century. In recognition of his service, we are honored to 
present to him The President's Award. 
JENNINGS G. McABEE 
The Honorable Jennings G. McAbee represents the people of Greenwood and 
McCormick counties in the South Carolina House of Representatives. 
Within the General Assembly, he serves all South Carolinians as chairman of the 
Natural Resources Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, which 
initiates the legislative budget process each year. 
In the Legislature, as well as in his native McCormick, Rep. McAbee is a strong 
advocate of and key adviser to Clemson's public service programs and activities. He 
understands the vital importance of agriculture and natural resources to our economy, 
and he is aware that economic pro(lress is highly dependent upon the information 
derived through research and provided to our citizens through instruction and extension programs. 
Rep. McAbee is a 1967 graduate of Wofford College, where he became a member 
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He began his legislative career in 1975, before 
which he served as county magistrate from 1970 until 1972. 
He contributes to his community as a 32nd Degree Mason and as a member of the 
Exchange Club, American Legion, Moose Lodge, Shriners, Jaycees and Lions Club. 
He is a former chairman of the Cancer Society and of the Boy Scout Fund and is an 
active member of the South Carolina National Guard. 
For his service to our state, its citizens and higher education, Clemson University 
is pleased to present The President's Award to Rep. Jennings McAbee.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is 1o replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of corneiian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical State1nent 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
