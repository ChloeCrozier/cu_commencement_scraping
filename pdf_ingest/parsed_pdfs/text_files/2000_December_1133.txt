HONORARY DEGREE 
ROBERT SIMS CAMPBELL, JR. 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Robert Sims Campbell, Jr. has been described by his wife, Betsy, as "a man of vision." It 
is this vision-his ability to see the possibilities and make them happen-that has touched 
so many people at Clemson University. 
After graduating from Clemson in 1937 with a General Science degree in Geology, 
Mr. Campbell began working full-time at his family business, Campbell Limestone 
Company, in Gaffney. He became president of the company just three years later when his 
father passed away. During World War II, he served as an Army officer in the Philippines 
and occupied Japan and was discharged with the rank of major. When he returned to South 
Carolina, he energetically devoted himself to turning his small family business into a 
thriving industry, one that eventually supplied most of the stone used to build the South 
Carolina section of I-85. His company merged with Vulcan Materials Company in 1968 to 
become one of the country's largest mining operations. His work as a conservationist during 
his long career earned him much recognition. He retired as vice president of Vu lean 
Materials in 1980. 
Professionally and personally, Mr. Campbell has participated in many organizations 
and received numerous awards. He was on the Board of Directors of the National Crushed 
Stone Association, served as senior warden at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in 
Gaffney and was on the Board of Trustees at York Place Episcopal Home for Children. He 
received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Limestone College in 1989 and was also 
named a life trustee of the college after serving 23 years on Limestone's board of trustees. 
In 1987 Clemson presented him the Clemson Medallion, its highest public award, and in 
1998 Governor David Beasley presented him with the Order of the Palmetto. 
Mr. Campbell served on the Clemson University Board of Trustees from 1956 to 1960. 
In 1986 he and his wife donated more than $1 million to Clemson to establish the Bob 
Campbell Chair of Technical Communications. At the time, it was the largest gift the 
University had ever received; it was also the first endowed chair of its kind in the country. 
Mr. Campbell endowed the chair because he felt that college graduates should be able to 
express their thoughts clearly, regardless of their major. His foresight and contributions 
have allowed Clemson to become a national leader in shaping the emerging field of 
technical communications. In fact, TIME magazine chose Clemson as its "Public College 
of the Year" in 2000 largely due to the University's excellence in teaching writing and 
communication skills. 
Mr. Campbell's other great love at Clemson is his field of study, geology. In 1991 he 
served on the College of Sciences Advisory Board. He continued his lifelong dedication to 
conservation when he established on campus both the Bob Campbell Geology Museum and 
the Campbell Natural History Museum. 
As a couple and through their personal foundations, Mr. Campbell and his wife have 
provided significant financial support to more than 30 programs at Clemson. He once said, 
"Clemson educated me to be what I am today, and whatever I was able to achieve, I did 
here in South Carolina. This is an opportunity to give something back." Mr. Campbell's 
unique vision for Clemson's future helped make the University what it is today. 
In recognition of his remarkable and creative contributions to Clemson University, it is 
with great honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, 
to Robert Sims Campbell, Jr.

HONORARY DEGREE 
BETSY MCDAVID CAMPBELL 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Betsy McDavid Campbell has spent her life helping others, and her devotion to 
Clemson University is no exception. She and her husband, Robert, have contributed to the 
development of more than 30 programs at Clemson through their individual contributions 
and foundations. 
Mrs. Campbell, a Greenville native, received her B.A. from Furman University in 1938 
and married that same year. Two years later, she and her husband began managing his 
family business, Campbell Limestone Company, in Gaffney, and worked together until 
1968 when the business merged with Vulcan Materials Company. Mr. Campbell continued 
to serve as vice president, while Mrs. Campbell began devoting time to her passion, 
working with socially challenged children. 
For many years Mrs. Campbell worked one-on-one with developmentally impaired and 
emotionally disturbed children. Through the Betsy Campbell Foundation, she has 
supported many youth initiatives, including the Sprouting Wings Program at Clemson. 
This creative after-school program in the S.C. Botanical Garden focuses on helping 
children succeed through connecting with nature. 
One of her most far-reaching contributions to C lemson came in 1986 when she and her 
husband donated over $1 million to establish the Bob Campbell Chair of Technical 
Communications, the first endowed chair of its kind in the nation. She said at the time, 
"We believe there is a real need for technical graduates to be able to communicate their 
ideas in a few words that can be understood and remembered." The effect of this 
endowment has been significant, gaining Clemson national recognition as a leader in 
technical communications. This year, TIME magazine chose Clemson as its "Public 
College of the Year" in large part because it is "on the cutting edge of the 
communications-across-the-curriculum movement." 
Mrs. Campbell has received many awards for her years of service to various 
organizations. As an active leader in the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Gaffney, 
Mrs. Campbell was presented the Henry B. Richardson Award at York Place Episcopal 
Home for Children. From 1993 to 1995, she served as a member of the Board of Trustees at 
York Place. Limestone College presented her an Honorary Alumnus Award in 1990 anJ 
awarded her an Honorary Doctorate in Public Service in 1999. In 1998 Governor David 
Beasley presented her with the Order of the Palmetto. 
Today, Mrs. Campbell's devotion to Clemson is still strong. In 1997 she contributed to 
the establishment of the Betsy Campbell Carriage House at the S.C. Botanical Garden. 
The first Betsy M. Campbell Learning Symposium for Teachers was held in 1999. She 
recently provided guidance and financial support to initiate a new opportunity to link the 
Clemson Community Scholars Program to elementary school enrichment programs so that 
the students can learn from one another. And in the fa ll of 2000, an organization she 
founded-Campbell Young Leaders Corporation-funded community service scholarships 
at Clemson and Furman. 
In recognition of these outstanding contributions to Clemson University, it is with 
great honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to 
Betsy McDavid Campbell.

HONORARY DEGREE 
JOSEPH FRANKLIN EDWARDS 
DOCTOR OF LAWS 
Joseph Franklin Edwards is a man known for his innovative contributions to the field of 
ceramic engineering. He is a dedicated leader in the brick industry and a faithful alumnus 
of Clemson University. 
A native of Saluda, Mr. Edwards graduated from Clemson with B.S. and M.S. degrees in 
Ceramic Engineering in 1956 and 1957. He was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, 
where he served as a navigator/bombardier in the Tactical Air Command from 1957 to 
1960. After his tour of duty, he moved to Kingsport, Tennessee, to join General Shale 
Products as a research engineer. He was promoted to director of research in 1964. In 1977 
Mr. Edwards transferred to the corporate office in Johnson City, Tennessee, after a 
promotion to director of engineering and research. He was named to his current position of 
vice president of engineering and research in 1980. 
During his years at General Shale Products, Mr. Edwards has guided the technical 
efforts of the company through countless projects of modernization, including the 
implementation of a single-layer kiln, the use of fly ash in concrete block and the 
conversion of the kilns from gas to coal. His groundbreaking research and publication on 
the freeze-thaw durability of brick products led to the adoption of the current criteria for 
durability from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). These criteria 
protect homeowners and building owners of all income levels from frost deterioration of 
brick. Under Mr. Edwards' guidance, General Shale has become one of the most 
technically proficient companies in the ceramic industry. 
During his career, he has been involved in a number of organizations, including 
ASTM, the American Ceramic Society and the Brick Institute of America (now the Brick 
Industry Association). Mr. Edwards was elected a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society 
in 1979 and received the ASTM Award of Merit in 1993. 
Mr. Edwards has offered his leadership skills and generosity to Clemson in many ways. 
In 1985, he was a member of a committee founding the Chad Health Trust Fund, which 
initially supported the late Dr. Gil Robinson's research for the brick industry. He became a 
member of the Executive Committee of the Center for Engineering Ceramic 
Manufacturing in 1987 and later served as the committee chairman. He was chairman 
during the crucial period when the Ceramic Center started the fund drive to build and 
equip the Bishop Ceramic Laboratory at Clemson Research Park. The majority of the 
pledges were obtained during his tenure, and he was influential in raising a total of $2.8 
million for the Bishop Lab. He was responsible for encouraging companies in the brick 
industry to donate more than $950,000, and his company has contributed $450,000 over the 
past decade. Additionally, Mr. Edwards' influence was key to getting the Tile Council of 
America to invest $1.l million in the Clemson Research Park. 
In recognition of his extraordinary leadership and contributions to Clemson University, 
it is with great honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to 
Joseph Franklin Edwards.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, 
a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the 
American Council on Education, are as follows:

Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic 
costumes of medieval o rigin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions o utside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second va riation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding 
institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma ll est, 
masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not awa rd 
hoods to bache lors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly , the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. 
The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph .D.) 
degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining spec ifies the awarding institution. The colors 
are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice chat the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although 
many combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is ~resently the only 
institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiast ica l, or military 
regalia as sec forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad 
in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but a rc 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, 
through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation 
such as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes 
the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or 
speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at 
the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the 
University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic 
clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's 
prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University 
in gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the 
University President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole 
body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, 
and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most 
acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were 
executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was 
executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University.

Historical Statement 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the 
Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a 
mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics 
and the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate 
of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to 
Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural 
Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in 
the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and 
his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an 
enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year 
curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the 
University has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, 
the College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and 
Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the 
Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, 
Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for 
Management Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors 
of Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of 
Teacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, 
and Society of American Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and 
at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is 
also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
