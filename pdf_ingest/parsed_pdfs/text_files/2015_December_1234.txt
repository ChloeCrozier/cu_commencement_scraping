HONORARY DEGREE 
Chief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Widely regarded as a model of great industry, determination and high integrity, Chief 
Justice Jean Hoefer Toal began her service as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court 
of South Carolina in 1988. The first woman to serve as a Justice of the South Carolina 
Supreme Court is also its longest serving member. Chief Justice Toal served as Chief Justice 
from 2000 until her retirement on December 31, 2015. 
Chief Justice Toal was born and attended elementary and high school in Columbia, South 
Carolina. She received her B.A. degree in philosophy from Agnes Scott College and her 
J.D. degree in 1968 from the University of South Carolina School of Law where she served 
as managing editor, leading articles editor and book review editor of the South Carolina 
Law Review. She is a member of the Order of the Coif, Mortar Board and Phi Beta Kappa. 
Chief Justice Toal practiced law for 20 years prior to her election to the South Carolina Supreme Court with the 
Haynsworth Law Firm in Greenville and with Belser, Baker, Barwick, Ravenel, Toal & Bender in Columbia . When she 
was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1968, women comprised less than one percent of the licensed lawyers in South 
Carolina. 
As a lawyer, Chief Justice Toal appeared in all levels of trial and appellate courts in South Carolina. She also had 
considerable experience as a litigator in United States District Court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and made one 
appearance as co-counsel before the United States Supreme Court. 
In addition to practicing law, Chief Justice Toal was active in public service. She served in the South Carolina House of 
Representatives representing Richland County for 13 years. She was the first woman in South Carolina to chair a standing 
committee of the House of Representatives and served as chairman of the House Rules Committee and chairman of the 
Constitutional Laws Sub-Committee of the House Judiciary Committee. 
During her 27 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Toal has written opinions addressing a full range of both criminal and 
civil issues and co-authored a book entitled Appellate Practice in South Carolina. 
In addition to her work on the bench, Chief Justice Toal has become chief advocate for South Carolina's Judicial 
Automation Project as a means of creating a more efficient court system. For her efforts, Chief Justice Toal was recognized 
by Government Technology magazine as one of the 2002 "Top 25 Doers, Dreamers & Drivers" of technology in 
government. 
ChiefJustice Toal has received numerous awards including the South Carolina Trial Lawyers Outstanding Contribution 
to Justice Award; the prestigious Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award from the American Bar 
Association's Commission on Women in the Profession; and the National Center for State Courts' Sandra Day O'Connor 
Award for the Advancement of Civics Education. She has served on the Clemson University Board of Visitors. 
Chief Justice Toal is married to her law-school classmate, William T. Toal. They live in Columbia and have two daughters 
and two grandchildren. Justice Toal enjoys a Clemson legacy through her father, Herbert Wellington Hoefer, a 1929 
Clemson College graduate with a B.S. in botl1 mechanical engineering and electrical engineering and her godfather, 
Theodore Marion Hoefer, a 1938 Clemson graduate with a B.S. in electrical engineering. 
For her untiring devotion to law, public service and the people of South Carolina, Clemson University is proud to bestow 
on Chief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal the honorary Doctorate of Humanities degree.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the univer ity marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the as embly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace i derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and si lver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethy t (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the govern ing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr. CC Wilson of Clemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
(1807-1888), who left the bulk of hi estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mine in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a 
scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, 
chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his 
assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina 
after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced 
only two four-year curricu la, supplemented by two two-year 
preparatory courses. Today the University ha six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions 
about the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association 
to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council 
for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association 
(CADE), American Society of Landscape Architects, Commission 
on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for 
Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs 
(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPN AALR Council on 
Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of 
American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is ava ilable 
in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged 
not only in its primary academic program, but does extensive 
research at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment 
stations located in the state. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension, which has professional personnel 
located in each of the state's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
