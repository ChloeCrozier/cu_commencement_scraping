HONORARY DEGREE 
MISS MARTHA FRANKS 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Miss Martha Franks, retired Baptist missionary, has lived a life devoted to 
serving others. "Miss Martha," as she is affectionately known, retired in 1966 to 
her hometown of Laurens after a 41-year career in China and Taiwan. 
Youngest of six children in a church-going family, her interest in becoming a 
missionary began to develop as a child in the Sunbeam Band, a Baptist organization for children, at First Baptist Church of Laurens. She made her commitment 
to foreign mission work while a student at Winthrop College, where she majored 
in education with emphasis on kindergarten work and earned a B.A. degree. 
Miss Franks taught kindergarten in Virginia for two years, and then went to 
Louisville, Kentucky, to study at the Woman's Missionary Union Training School 
(now merged with Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) for a year. In 1925 she 
was appointed by the Foreign Mission Board and sailed for China. 
Upon retirement, Miss Franks had given more than 40 years of service 
among the Chinese. She had lived through their wars and revolutions and was 
twice interned by hostile armies. She had witnessed their sufferings under the 
repressive regimes of the Japanese and the Communists and had felt the effects 
of the great social and political upheaval which was to alter profoundly the old 
China she had known. 
Her last overseas post was Hsinchu, Taiwan, where she worked in a church 
for a year before her return to the States in 1965. Previously she was dean of 
women at Baptist theological seminaries in Taipei, Taiwan, and Shanghai and 
Hwanghsien, China, and educational and evangelistic worker in Hwanghsien and 
Tsining, China. 
There are many stories about her warmth, wit, persistence and versatility. 
She played the accordion for street meetings in Taipei, attracting crowds from 
which came the nucleus of True Light Baptist Church. She taught a seven-yearold blind boy to read by forming Chinese characters for him with marbles placed 
in a tray of sand. And she drove a panel truck from Laurens to San Francisco so 
she could take it to Taiwan for use in Baptist work. 
Since returning home, she has directed her energies toward the establishment in Laurens of a Christian retirement center for r
1
etirees from all faiths. 
Ground was broken in 1983, and today, the Martha Franks Baptist Retirement 
Center is among the finest in the state. But Miss Franks' work in her "retirement" 
years has not been limited to her concerns for the aging. 
She began a new ministry among her own people, driving to places throughout the Carolinas and Georgia to fulfill a heavy schedule of speaking engagements, 
mostly to high school students, to tell them first-hand about the oppressions of 
Communism. 
It has been said of her that, "Wherever Martha Franks goes, she leaves a 
trail of sunshine." Others have said, "In joy, sadness, illness, despair, disappointment, or triumph, she always knows exactly what to say, when to say it, and how 
to say it." 
Clemson University is honored to recognize and salute the life's work of 
a great humanitarian, Miss Martha Franks, through the presentation of this 
honorary doctoral degree.

HONORARY DEGREE 
HOWARD ALLEN SCHNEIDERMAN 
DOCTOR OF LETTERS 
Dr. Howard A. Schneiderman is senior vice president of research and development and chief scientist at the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, Missouri. 
Dr. Schneiderman joined Monsanto in 1979 and can be credited with the 
company's bold moves into the field of biotechnology. He has been a key player 
in establishing Monsanto as a leader in basic and applied biotechnology research. 
Dr. Schneiderman also has forged university-industry programs for basic research 
in biology which are among the most successful anywhere. 
In 1987 Clemson joined with Monsanto as an academic collaborator in a 
research partnership to field test a genetically engineered soil microorganism 
developed by Monsanto scientists. 
Dr. Schneiderman serves as an Advisory Director to the Monsanto Board of 
Directors and a member of the company's Executive Management Committee. He 
is a member of the Board of Directors of G. D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical 
company wholly owned by Monsanto. 
A New York native, he earned his B.A. degree at Swarthmore College, graduating with high honors in mathematics and natural sciences, and his M.A. (zoology)) and Ph.D. (physiology) degrees at Harvard University. 
An avid backpacker, he is a member of the Board of Trustees of the 
Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the Expert Committee for the Secretariat of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, many professional societies, and he was on the 
Board of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
He is presently a member of the visiting committees of Harvard University 
and Carnegie Mellon University and is an Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and 
of Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. He is a member of the Board of 
Trustees of the Missouri Botanical Garden. He also remains professor on Leave 
at the University of California, Irvine, where he maintains an active professional 
interest in research in developmental biology. 
Dr. Schneiderman has been a member of many editorial and advisory boards 
and continues to edit a series of textbooks in biology. He has authored more 
than 200 published research papers on various subjects, including developmental 
biology and genetics, insect biochemistry, and plant growth. More recently he 
has published various articles on industrial biotechnology and on unlversityindustry interactions. 
In 1975 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences and 
a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1983 the University 
of Nebraska gave him the Gustavson Award, and the Entomological Society of 
America named him recipient of its Founder's Memorial Award. He holds a 
Presidential appointment to the National Science Board. His term will expire in 
1992. 
Clemson University holds Dr. Howard Schneiderman and his distinguished 
achievements in the highest regard, and it is both an honor and a pleasure to 
award this honorary doctoral degree to him.

The President's Award 
JOHN B. AMOS LESLIE G. McGRAW, JR. 
JOHN B. AMOS 
John B. Amos heads a multimillion dollar insurance and communications organization from its corporate headquarters in Columbus, Georgia. He is chairman and chief 
executive officer of American Family Corporation and American Family Life Assurance 
Company, which he founded in 1955. 
American Family Corporation is a holding company with various subsidiaries. One 
of them, American Family Life Assurance Company, has become the world's leading 
seller of cancer insurance. Other subsidiaries include a broadcast group of eight TV 
stations and a diversified printing and communications operation. 
His 1ies with Clemson began during the University's campaign to build the Strom 
Thurmond Institute Building. He was the largest single benefactor toward construction 
of this project. Long a friend and admirer of South Carolina's senior senator, Mr. Amos 
currently is serving as national chairman of 1he $3.7 million campaign to endow the 
Strom Thurmond Institute of Government and Public Affairs. 
He is a native of Enterprise, Alabama, and is a champion of America's system of 
free enterprise. At age 14, Mr. Amos founded a weekly newspaper in Florida and was 
its editor and publisher for five years. He studied pre-law at the University of Miami 
and earned his J.D. degree at the University of Florida Law School in 1949. 
His honors include the "Georgian of the Year" Award presented in 1986 by the 
National Association of Broadcasters. In 1987 Mr. Amos was named by Forbes Magazine as the chief executive officer of the most innovative insurance company. 
LESLIE G. McCRAW, JR. 
From his boyhood in the shadows of Tillman Hall to the head of a multinational 
corporation based on the West Coast, South Carolinian and Clemson University alumnus Leslie Mccraw has nurtured and maintained an affection for his alma mater. 
Born in nearby Sandy Springs, Les is president of Fluor Corporation, which had 
revenues last year of more than $5 billion. He earned his undergraduate degree at 
Clemson, graduating in 1956 with a B.S. degree in civil engineering and a commission 
in the Air Force. 
In 1975 he joined Greenville's Daniel Construction, then one of the top five constructors in the nation. Daniel was purchased by Fluor Corporation in 1977, and Les 
was named president of Daniel in 1982. He became CEO in 1984 and was named to 
Fluor's Board of Directors in 1984. 
In 1986 he was named president and CEO of a new company - Fluor Daniel -
which melded the engineering, construction and maintenance capabilities of Fluor and 
Daniel. He set up the company's headquarters in Irvine, California, and began the 
challenging task of merging two corporate cultures. In 1988 he was named President 
of Fluor Corporation. 
His commitment to higher education is exemplified by the time he devotes to 
serving on the Board of Trustees for Hampden-Sydney College and Columbia College, 
and at Clemson, where he has been a close adviser to President Max Lennon, serving 
as chairman of the President's Advisory Council. He also is a strong advocate of 
Clemson's College of Engineering and serves on its Advisory Board.

The Academic Procession 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored 
guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
Following the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of 
colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as follows: 
College Colors Discipline 
Agriculture Maize Agriculture 
Architecture Brown Fine Arts 
Lilac Architecture 
Commerce & Industry Copper Economics 
Drab Business 
Education Light Blue Education 
Engineering Orange Engineering 
Forest & Recreation Russet Forestry 
Resources Sage Green Recreation Education 
Liberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy 
White Letters & Humanities 
Cream Social Science 
Library Lemon Library 
Nursing Apricot Nursing 
Sciences Golden Yellow Sciences 
Staff Purple & Orange Academic Support 
Collegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside 
the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are 
specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are 
black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels 
usually of metallic thread ; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also 
black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while 
those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like 
sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet 
bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet 
with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. 
First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to 
bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, 
the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in 
combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V" ). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in 
a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University 
mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are 
dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 9
The University Regalia 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through 
its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's 
stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close 
of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, 
the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial 
maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in 
gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and 
amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the 
office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University 
President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the 
institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian 
and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of 
office" which were carried by th·e senior members of departments of state or 
church. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the 
discipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut 
wood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the 
late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late 
Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. 

Page 10
Coat of Arms 
Designed by Clemson University graphic artist, 
Connie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic 
three-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research 
and service. 
Pictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided 
into three parts. The bottom contains a series of open 
books representing the concept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books 
and the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the University as it is achieved through 
undergraduate and graduate instruction. 
The upper portion of the shield contains two sets 
of calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -
the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the humanities, technology and science. 
The entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the 
abiding spirit of Clemson. 
The crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes 
Thomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become 
"the people's university" for South Carolinians. It rises 
from a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The 
outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official 
colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and 
white, are Clemson's student colors.

Historical State1nent 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who 
left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, 
and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of 
the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership 
in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, 
a political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as 
a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment 
of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has 
ten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of 
Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation 
Resources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of 
Sciences, and the Graduate School. 
The institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, 
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board. for 
Engineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its 
primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus 
and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University 
is also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the 
work of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each 
of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
A. C. Corcoran, '19 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of great conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
