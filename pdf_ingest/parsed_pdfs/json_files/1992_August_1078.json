Self, textile industry leader, philanthropist and benefac\u0002tor to Clemson University, is Chairman of the Executive Committee of Greenwood \r\nMills, Inc. \r\nA native of Greenwood, Mr. Self attended Greenwood public schools and Qraduated \r\nfrom The Citadel (1941) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. \r\nFor the next five years he served in the Coast Artillery and was honorably discharged \r\nas a Major. \r\nMr. Self has been with Greenwood Mills for fifty-seven years. He began working \r\nwith the company in 1935 at age sixteen and has held various positions of leadership \r\nthrough the years. He has devoted his professional life to setting innovative stan\u0002dards of excellence in the textile industry and in bettering the lives of textile em\u0002ployees. He has served as Chairman of the Executive Committee since 1984. Mr. Self's \r\nfather, the late James C. Self, acquired Greenwood Mills in 1908. The company has \r\nbeen under continuous family control since then. \r\nAs president and trustee of The Self Foundation's Board of Trustees, Mr. Self has \r\ndevoted his energies to health care, higher education, youth and elderly activities, \r\nand cultural and historical projects. \r\nMr. Self has been a generous benefactor to Clemson University where he served \r\nas a life trustee for twenty-nine years. He personally has given more than $300,000 \r\nfor various purposes. The Self Foundation has provided almost $1 million, including a \r\nrecent gift of $250,000 for the proposed Student Center on East Campus. In addition, \r\nMr. Self has left a $500,000 bequest to benefit the Student Center. \r\nIn 1960 Mr. Self was elected a Life Member of the Clemson Board of Trustees.

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nR. DAVID THOMAS \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nDave Thomas is the founder of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants, a \r\nvocal advocate for adoption and an American folk hero. Without a high school edu\u0002cation, Mr. Thomas became a millionaire at the age of 35 through hard work, per\u0002severance and a burning desire to succeed. \r\nMr. Thomas, who refers to himself as \u00b7\"a grill man who got a couple of breaks \r\nalong the way,\" is a familiar face today to millions of TV viewers of his Wendy's \r\ncommercials. His dream of creating a better hamburger has led him to the top of a \r\nmulti-billion dollar, multi-national business in 29 countries with more than 130,000 \r\nemployees and annual sales of $3.2 billion. \r\nHe was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but never knew his birth parents. When \r\nhe was six weeks old, he was adopted by a couple from Kalamazoo, Michigan, Rex \r\nand Auleva Thomas. His adoptive mother died when he was five, and his early years \r\nsaw numerous moves from state to state as his adoptive father sought work. \r\n\"This wasn't easy,\" Mr. Thomas said. \"No roots; no sense of belonging. With all \r\nthat moving, I didn't get a chance to know kids. I guess that's why work became my \r\nconstant companion.\" But he is grateful for the challenges his childhood presented. \r\n\"Some people see my early life as an adversity, but it created a drive in me. I lived \r\nto make money, but money wasn't the only important thing. It also was the sense of \r\naccomplishment.\" \r\nMr. Thomas learned a lot about the fast-food business from one of the real pros -\r\nColonel Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 1956 Mr. Thomas \r\nwas working at a barbecue restaurant opened by his boss, Phil Clauss, when he met \r\nColonel Sanders, a man who became one of the greatest influences in his life. The \r\nColonel was traveling nationwide to promote his new fried chicken franchise. Mr. \r\nClauss bought the franchise, and Mr. Thomas learned all about the chicken business. \r\nIn 1962 Mr. Clauss gave Mr. Thomas an opportunity to save four failing Kentucky \r\nFried Chicken carryouts in Columbus, Ohio, from bankruptcy, make them profitable, \r\nand pay off a $200,000 deficit. If successful, Mr. Thomas would receive 45 percent of \r\nthe Columbus franchise. \"I had four kids and a wife and was making $135 a week, \r\nbut I made up my mind that I was going to be in business for myself.\" \r\nThe restaurants prospered, and Mr. Thomas added four more Columbus locations. \r\nSix years later he sold the restaurants back to Kentucky Fried Chicken for $1.5 \r\nmillion, becoming a millionaire at age 35. Mr. Thomas opened the first Wendy's Old \r\nFashioned Hamburgers restaurant on November 15, 1969, in downtown Columbus, \r\ngoing against the advice of critics who said the restaurant industry already was \r\nsaturated. He named his new restaurant after his eight-year-old daughter, Melinda Lou, \r\nnicknamed \"Wendy\" by her brother and sisters. \r\nA cause that perhaps is closest to Thomas' heart is adoption. In 1990, President \r\nBush asked him to be a national spokesperson for a White House initiative on adop\u0002tion, \"Adoption Works ... For Everyone.\" In this capacity, Thomas works tirelessly \r\nto raise awareness of adoption nationwide. Thomas' belief that every child deserves \r\na permanent home and love drives him to continue his work to promote adoption. \r\nDave's Way, Thomas' autobiography, was published in September 1991. During a \r\nnational 35-city book tour, Thomas had the opportunity to promote adoption during \r\nmore than 225 media interviews and speeches. Thomas has pledged all his book \r\nprofits to national adoption awareness programs. \r\nClemson University holds Dave Thomas and his remarkable achievements in the \r\nhighest regard, and it is a special privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor \r\nof Humanities, to him.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its mar\u0002shal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of \r\ncolors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were estab\u0002lished by the American Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Discipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nArchitecture \r\nCommerce & Industry \r\nEducation \r\nEngineering \r\nForest & Recreation \r\nResources \r\nLiberal Arts \r\nLibrary \r\nNursing \r\nSciences \r\nStaff \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nLilac \r\nCopper \r\nDrab \r\nLight Blue \r\nOrange \r\nRusset \r\nSage Green \r\nDark Blue \r\nWhite \r\nCream \r\nLemon \r\nApricot \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nPurple & Orange \r\nAgriculture \r\nFine Arts \r\nArchitecture \r\nEconomics \r\nBusiness \r\nEducation \r\nEngineering \r\nForestry \r\nRecreation Education \r\nPhilosophy \r\nLetters & Humanities \r\nSocial Science \r\nLibrary \r\nNursing \r\nSciences \r\nAcademic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic cos\u0002tumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the univer\u0002sity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' lar\u0002ger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that reg\u0002istered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military re\u0002galia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in \r\na gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the Presi\u0002dent into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close \r\nof a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, \r\nthe close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. its basic club\u0002iike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's pre\u0002history. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in \r\ngold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and \r\namethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the \r\nlate Professor Marshall C. Beil, and the lapidary work was executed by the late \r\nMr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Coat of Arms \r\nDesigned by Clemson University graphic artist, \r\nConnie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic \r\nthree-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research \r\nand service. \r\nPictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided \r\ninto three parts. The bottom contains a series of open \r\nbooks representing the concept of teaching as the ba\u0002sis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teach\u0002ing mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets \r\nof calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measure\u0002ment system for research, as well as Clemson's tradi\u0002tion in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -\r\nthe books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also repre\u0002sent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange cen\u0002ter shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the \r\nabiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes \r\nThomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become \r\n\"the people's university\" for South Carolinians. It rises \r\nfrom a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The \r\nouter pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official \r\ncolors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agri\u0002culture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, \r\nand agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of \r\nthe Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership \r\nin South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, \r\na political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Col\u0002leges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural \r\nAccrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, \r\nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for \r\nEngineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation. \r\nClemson Is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in Its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus \r\nand at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University \r\nis also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located In each \r\nof the State's counties.
