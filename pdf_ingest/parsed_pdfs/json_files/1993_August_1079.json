Coker, distinguished South Carolinian, award-winning business execu\u0002tive and community leader, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sonoco \r\nProducts Company, a Fortune 500 giant and one of the state's major industries. \r\nMr. Coker was raised in the Darlington County community of Hartsville, the loca\u0002tion of Sonoco's corporate headquarters. He is a graduate of Woodberry Forest School \r\nin Virginia and received the Bachelor of Arts degree (1955) from Princeton University \r\nand a master's degree (1957) in business administration from the Harvard Business \r\nSchool. \r\nMr. Coker began full-time employment with Sonoco in 1958, was named Executive \r\nVice President in 1966 and became President in 1970. In 1990 he was named Chair\u0002man of the Board and maintained the title and responsibilities of Chief Executive \r\nOfficer. \r\nToday's Sonoco Products Company evolved from modest beginnings around the \r\nturn of the century. It began as a South Carolina home-grown company in 1899, \r\nfounded as Southern Novelty Company, a family-owned business, by Mr. Coker's great\u0002grandfather, Major James Lide Coker. Working in a rented warehouse in Hartsville, the \r\ncompany's twelve employees manufactured paper cones used by the textile industry \r\nin the winding of yarn and threads. \r\nAlthough still making textile cones, Sonoco has diversified its product line into \r\nscores of packaging products with a multitude of industrial and consumer applica\u0002tions. The company has become a global giant, with more than 250 plants on five \r\ncontinents and approximately 16,000 employees, some 3,000 of whom are in South \r\nCarolina. \r\nDuring Mr. Coker's 22 years of leadership as President, sales of the company \r\nhave grown from $125 million to more than $1 .8 billion at the end of 1992. The \r\ncompany's 1992 Fortune 500 ranking in sales was 231st, in net earnings 149th, earn\u0002ings as a percent of sales 127th, and as a percent of equity 104th. \r\nIn addition to his directorship at Sonoco, Mr. Coker also serves on the boards \r\nof NationsBank. Springs Industries, Carolina Power and Light Company, Sara Lee \r\nCorporation, American Forest and Paper Association, Palmetto Seed Capital Corpora\u0002tion, The University of Virginia Darden School Foundation, and Hollings Oncology \r\nCenter. \r\nActive in both civic and business affairs, he is a member of the Palmetto Business \r\nForum, a past president of the Hartsville Rotary Club and the Pee Dee Area Council \r\nof the Boy Scouts of America. He is a recipient of the Silver Beaver Award for out\u0002standing service to scouting. \r\nMany times he has been honored by his peers for leadership and achievements \r\nin the business world . In 1985 he was named South Carolina Businessman of the \r\nYear by the S. C. Chamber of Commerce, and in 1991 he was inducted into the \r\nSouth Carolina Business Hall of Fame. \r\nHis leadership, dedication and commitment have provided industrial growth, job \r\nopportunities and other economic and social gains for South Carolina as well as for \r\nthe country. Charlie Coker's numerous accomplishments have brought great credit to \r\nhimself and to the State and are held in the highest regard by his friends and fellow \r\nSouth Carolinians. It is a privilege to honor him with the presentation of the honorary \r\ndegree, Doctor of Humanities. "

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nBUTLER C. DERRICK, JR. \r\nDOCTOR OF LAWS \r\nThe Honorable Butler C. Derrick, Jr., who represents South Carolina's Third Con\u0002gressional District, is serving his 10th term in Congress. \r\nMr. Derrick, who first was elected to Congress in 1974, is a chief deputy whip, a \r\nleadership position which is the fifth most senior in the House leadership and helps \r\nset the legislative agenda and build coalitions for passage or defeat of major bills. \r\nCongressman Derrick's appointment is the first time in 130 years that a South \r\nCarolinian has been named to a top leadership post in the U. S. House of Representa- tives. \r\nAs Vice Chairman of the powerful Rules Committee, he is involved in almost every \r\npiece of legislation debated on the floor of the House. This committee, considered one \r\nof the three most influential committees in the House, determines which legislation is \r\nconsidered as well as how and when it will be debated on the House floor. \r\nHe has long been a good friend to Clemson University and a strong supporter of \r\nClemson's work to serve the textile industry, continu ing education needs, and agricul\u0002tural research and cooperative extension work. \r\nCongressman Derrick won approval of funding for the National Textile Center to \r\nhelp U.S. textile makers be more competitive with markets overseas. The center is lo\u0002cated at Clemson and at three other member institutions. \r\nCongressman Derrick also secured a $1 .5 million grant from the Department of \r\nHousing and Urban Development to equip the University's teleconferencing center in \r\nthe planned continuing education and conference center. The grant will enable the new \r\nfacility to serve as an \" electronic classroom\" by transmitting its classes around the \r\nworld. \r\nHe attended the University of South Carolina and earned a law degree at the \r\nUniversity of Georgia (1965). Four years later he was elected to the S. C. House of \r\nRepresentatives, the beginning of his long legislative career. He continued to practice \r\nlaw in Edgefield until he was elected to Congress in 1974. \r\nKnown by his colleagues as a congressman with a quiet operating style, Derrick \r\noften works behind the scenes to get things done. This legislative style and his moder\u0002ate, conservative political philosophy are attributes which Derrick brings to his leader\u0002ship position. Now in his 19th year in the House of Representatives, Congressman Derrick has \r\ncompiled an outstanding record of being a strong spokesman and advocate on matters \r\nand issues affecting his district and state. It is a special privilege for Clemson University to honor this distinguished South \r\nCarolinian and American. We hold his achievements in the highest regard, and it is a \r\npleasure to award him the honorary Doctor of Laws degree. "

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its mar\u0002shal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of \r\ncolors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were estab\u0002lished by the American Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Discipline \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic cos\u0002tumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread ; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the univer\u0002sity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' lar\u0002ger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that reg\u0002istered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military re\u0002galia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in \r\na gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the Presi\u0002dent into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close \r\nof a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, \r\nthe close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club\u0002like shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's pre\u0002history. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in \r\ngold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and \r\namethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the \r\nlate Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late \r\nMr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Coat of Arms \r\nDesigned by Clemson University graphic artist, \r\nConnie Floyd, the coat of arms represents the historic \r\nthree-fold mission of this institution: teaching, research \r\nand service. \r\nPictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided \r\ninto three parts. The bottom contains a series of open \r\nbooks representing the concept of teaching as the ba\u0002sis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teach\u0002ing mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets \r\nof calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measure\u0002ment system for research, as well as Clemson's tradi\u0002tion in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -\r\nthe books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also repre\u0002sent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange cen\u0002ter shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the \r\nabiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes \r\nThomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become \r\n\"the people's university\" for South Carolinians. It rises \r\nfrom a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The \r\nouter pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official \r\ncolors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical State1nent \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agri\u0002culture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, \r\nand agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of \r\nthe Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership \r\nin South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, \r\na political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Col\u0002leges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural \r\nAccrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, \r\nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for \r\nEngineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus \r\nand at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University \r\nis also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
