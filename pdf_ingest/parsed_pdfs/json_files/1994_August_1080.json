        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nSISTER MARILYN FISCHER, S.F.P. \r\nSister Marilyn Fischer, S.F.P., is Chairperson of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor \r\nHealth System (HSI) and the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation of Brooklyn \r\nHeights, New York. \r\nSister Marilyn, a native of Quincy, Illinois, entered the congregation of the Fran\u0002ciscan Sisters of the Poor on September 17, 1958, and made her perpetual vows on \r\nAugust 25, 1966. She began her professional religious career as an instructor in the \r\nSchool of Nursing at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. \r\nIt wasn't long before her superiors recognized her gift for leadership, and in 1968 \r\nshe was named congregational Director of Formation. One year later she was appoint\u0002ed President of Region VI of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Formation Council, a \r\nmember of the national board of the Sister Formation Conference, and a member of \r\nthe Board of Trustees of St. Elizabeth's. \r\nIn 1977 Sister Marilyn was appointed to the health care ministry core group and \r\nsoon after was elected to the leadership board of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor. \r\nWhat followed was a sixteen year period of intense study to plan the future of the \r\nmore than 20 facilities the Sisters sponsor in the United States. \r\nIn 1980 Sister Marilyn was elected President of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, \r\ngiving leadership to Sisters and ministries throughout the congregation in Africa, Bra\u0002zil, Italy and the United States. Recognizing the need to respond to a changing and \r\nmore complex health care environment in the United States, Sister Marilyn united a \r\ndiverse group of health care providers (hospitals, nursing homes, social service cen\u0002ters, retirement communities) scattered throughout six states into one of the largest \r\nCatholic health systems in the country, with more than 5,000 beds and $700 million in \r\nannual operating revenues. \r\nWhen the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Health System came into being in 1983, \r\nSister Marilyn was appointed chairperson. She has led the system through changes \r\nin reimbursement, through the divestiture of two hospitals, and through several years \r\nof declining operating trends. Today, it is a vibrant, financially healthy system which \r\nlast year provided care to more than 800,000 people and more than $17 million in \r\ncharity care to the poor. \r\nSimilarly, when the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation was created in \r\n1984 as the newly formed philanthropic arm both of the health system and the con\u0002gregation, Sister Marilyn was appointed chairperson. In that time the Foundation has \r\nraised more than $40 million. As Foundation chairperson, Sister Marilyn helped create \r\nthe Franciscan Health Care Games, one of the largest and most successful annual \r\nfund-raising events in the country. \r\nThroughout a long and distinguished career in corporate leadership positions, \r\nSister Marilyn has remained, at heart, a Franciscan Sister of the Poor. Always mindful \r\nof those in need, she more recently has led the Foundation to develop support for the \r\nSisters' relief efforts in Africa, Brazil and Italy and is currently leading the Foundation \r\nthrough a national $25 million capital endowment campaign. \r\nShe is a gentle, compassionate woman whose lifetime of service to others and \r\ndevotion to prom'oting the welfare of humanity is well known. We hold Sister Marilyn \r\nFischer's achievements in the highest regard, and it is a special privilege to award the \r\nhonorary Doctor of Humanities degree to her. "

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a \r\nsenior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American \r\nCouncil on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Dlsclpllne \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of \r\nmedieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States \r\nwear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified \r\nby a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually \r\nmortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other \r\ndegrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, \r\nare longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since \r\n1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is \r\nmarked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are \r\nblack with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A \r\nsecond variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and \r\ndoctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width \r\nof the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim \r\nedging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which \r\ndesignates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the \r\nawarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice \r\nthat the Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). \r\nAlthough many combinations are duplicated by dozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set \r\nforth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in \r\ngold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, \r\nthe faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, \r\nwhen the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of \r\nClemson University and must be present at any convocation where the \r\nUniversity, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any \r\nofficial convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, \r\ncarrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace \r\nrests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the \r\nceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, \r\nthus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the \r\nceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle \r\nAges. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably \r\ngoing back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, \r\nwith the seal of the University in gold and the University colors \r\nrepresented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). \r\nAmethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in \r\nthe office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the \r\nwhole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of \r\nsilver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \r\n\"staffs of office\" which were carried by the senior members of \r\ndepartments of state or church. They display the seal of the University \r\nand the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. \r\nClemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert \r\nEbendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of \r\nthe most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the \r\nbatons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the \r\nlapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson \r\nUniversity. "

        "text": "Coat of Arms \r\nDesigned by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, \r\nthe coat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this \r\ninstitution: teaching, research and service. \r\nPictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. \r\nThe bottom contains a series of open books representing the \r\nconcept of teaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The \r\nwhite of the books and the purple of the background designate the \r\nteaching mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and \r\nwheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, \r\nas well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The \r\nthree symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also \r\nrepresent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield \r\nbearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of \r\nClemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas \r\nGreen Clemson's desire that Clemson become \"the people's \r\nuniversity\" for South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, \r\norange, white and gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, \r\nare the official colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life \r\nof a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific \r\nagriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-\r\n1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington \r\n(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, \r\nchemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the \r\nfounding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his \r\nleadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson \r\nUniversity. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a \r\nnational shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National \r\nArchitectural Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of \r\nAmerican Foresters, American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, \r\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and National Council for \r\nAccreditation of Teacher Education. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also \r\nheavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of \r\nagricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the \r\nState's counties.
