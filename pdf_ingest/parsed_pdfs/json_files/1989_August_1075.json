She made her commitment \r\nto foreign mission work while a student at Winthrop College, where she majored \r\nin education with emphasis on kindergarten work and earned a B.A. degree. \r\nMiss Franks taught kindergarten in Virginia for two years, and then went to \r\nLouisville, Kentucky, to study at the Woman's Missionary Union Training School \r\n(now merged with Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) for a year. In 1925 she \r\nwas appointed by the Foreign Mission Board and sailed for China. \r\nUpon retirement, Miss Franks had given more than 40 years of service \r\namong the Chinese. She had lived through their wars and revolutions and was \r\ntwice interned by hostile armies. She had witnessed their sufferings under the \r\nrepressive regimes of the Japanese and the Communists and had felt the effects \r\nof the great social and political upheaval which was to alter profoundly the old \r\nChina she had known. \r\nHer last overseas post was Hsinchu, Taiwan, where she worked in a church \r\nfor a year before her return to the States in 1965. Previously she was dean of \r\nwomen at Baptist theological seminaries in Taipei, Taiwan, and Shanghai and \r\nHwanghsien, China, and educational and evangelistic worker in Hwanghsien and \r\nTsining, China. \r\nThere are many stories about her warmth, wit, persistence and versatility. \r\nShe played the accordion for street meetings in Taipei, attracting crowds from \r\nwhich came the nucleus of True Light Baptist Church. She taught a seven-year\u0002old blind boy to read by forming Chinese characters for him with marbles placed \r\nin a tray of sand. And she drove a panel truck from Laurens to San Francisco so \r\nshe could take it to Taiwan for use in Baptist work. \r\nSince returning home, she has directed her energies toward the establish\u0002ment in Laurens of a Christian retirement center for r\r\n1\r\netirees from all faiths. \r\nGround was broken in 1983, and today, the Martha Franks Baptist Retirement \r\nCenter is among the finest in the state. But Miss Franks' work in her \"retirement\" \r\nyears has not been limited to her concerns for the aging. \r\nShe began a new ministry among her own people, driving to places through\u0002out the Carolinas and Georgia to fulfill a heavy schedule of speaking engagements, \r\nmostly to high school students, to tell them first-hand about the oppressions of \r\nCommunism. \r\nIt has been said of her that, \"Wherever Martha Franks goes, she leaves a \r\ntrail of sunshine.\" Others have said, \"In joy, sadness, illness, despair, disappoint\u0002ment, or triumph, she always knows exactly what to say, when to say it, and how \r\nto say it.\" \r\nClemson University is honored to recognize and salute the life's work of \r\na great humanitarian, Miss Martha Franks, through the presentation of this \r\nhonorary doctoral degree.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its mar\u0002shal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of \r\ncolors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were estab\u0002lished by the American Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Discipline \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic cos\u0002tumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread ; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the univer\u0002sity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' lar\u0002ger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\" ). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that reg\u0002istered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military re\u0002galia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in \r\na gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the Presi\u0002dent into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close \r\nof a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, \r\nthe close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club\u0002like shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's pre\u0002history. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in \r\ngold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and \r\namethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by th\u00b7e senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the \r\nlate Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late \r\nMr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

The bottom contains a series of open \r\nbooks representing the concept of teaching as the ba\u0002sis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teach\u0002ing mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets \r\nof calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measure\u0002ment system for research, as well as Clemson's tradi\u0002tion in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -\r\nthe books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also repre\u0002sent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange cen\u0002ter shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the \r\nabiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes \r\nThomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become \r\n\"the people's university\" for South Carolinians. It rises \r\nfrom a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The \r\nouter pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official \r\ncolors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical State1nent \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agri\u0002culture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, \r\nand agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of \r\nthe Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership \r\nin South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, \r\na political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Col\u0002leges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural \r\nAccrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, \r\nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board. for \r\nEngineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus \r\nand at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University \r\nis also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
