        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nM. DAVID EGAN \r\nDOCTOR OF LAWS \r\nClemson University Professor Emeritus M. David Egan is a distinguished educator, \r\nlecturer, author and consultant. Born in Trenton, New Jersey, he earned his undergraduate \r\ndegree from Lafayette College in 1962 and his master's degree from Massachusetts Institute \r\nof Technology in 1966. From 1962 to 1964, he served as a U.S. Army officer commanding \r\nOrdnance troops in the Foret de Trois-Fontaines, France. \r\nIn 1972, Professor Egan joined Clemson's faculty in the School of Design and Building. \r\nBecause of his dedication, expertise and professionalism in the classroom and consulting, \r\nhe gained the reputation for being a leader. For more than 30 years, Professor Egan has \r\nexcelled as an educator in the areas of architectural acoustics, lighting, fire and life safety, \r\nand low-energy design. He has authored six major textbooks and several sections in \r\nreference books for architects and engineers. His textbooks are not only a part of Clemson's \r\ncurriculum but also curricula of more than 200 schools worldwide. \r\nProfessor Egan's service to Clemson University has placed him in high regard among \r\nhis professional and collegiate peers and has brought credit and recognition to the \r\nUniversity and the School of Design and Building. Principally through his teaching, \r\nwriting and consulting on acoustics, his contributions to education and architecture are \r\nuniversally recognized. \r\nHis numerous awards include advancement to Fellowship in the Acoustical Society of \r\nAmerica, election as vice president of the National Council of Acoustical Consultants, \r\nboard certification by the Institute of Noise Control Engineering, honorary membership in \r\nthe American Institute of Architects and recognition as Lifetime Distinguished Professor \r\nof the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. \r\nA testament of Professor Egan's dedication to public service and justice is the story of \r\nhis untiring efforts to obtain recognition for three forgotten heroes of the Vietnam War. It \r\ntook nine years, but Professor Egan's remarkable leadership, determination and \r\nresourcefulness brought the effort to a successful conclusion. On March 6, 1998, 30 years \r\nafter the shameful massacre at My Lai, the U.S. Army awarded Soldier's Medals to Hugh \r\nC. Thompson Jr., Lawrence M. Colburn and Glenn U. Andreotta (posthumously) for their \r\nintervention to save lives of defenseless civilians and end the massacre. \r\nProfessor Egan embodies those ideals that Clemson University values. His wide \r\nrecognition and respect as a humanitarian, an author and an educator place him in a \r\nunique position to represent Clemson and its mission to audiences throughout the world. \r\nClemson University holds. Professor Emeritus Martin David Egan and his lifetime \r\nachievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the \r\npresentation of the Doctor of Laws. "

Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as fo llows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma llest, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown . \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining spec ifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson \r\nUniversity hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"Y\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military \r\nregalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand carnelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. t\\.obert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington {1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446.
