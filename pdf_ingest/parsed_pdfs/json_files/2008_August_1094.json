        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nMARGARET HEBARD LLOYD \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nMargaret Hebard Lloyd has succeeded in embodying the philosophy of Joseph Campbell to \"follow \r\none's bliss\" through her nonconformist passions and philanthropic endeavors. A true Renaiss<1nce \r\nwoman, Lloyd is honored today for her generosity, humility and unceasing vivacity. \r\nThrough her lifelong campaign of intellectual pursuit, Margaret Lloyd has developed and \r\nsupported the value of education for the purpose of improving oneself and one's surroundings. At \r\na time when higher education for women was not supported, Lloyd persisted in self-education \r\nthrough literature, travel and observation, resulting in a vivid interest and expertise in many fields \r\nand a passion for philanthropy. \r\nHer esteem for learning with the purpose of influencing is exemplified in her fervor for speaking at \r\nnational and international conferences and in her numerous projects designed to direct people \r\ntoward a better interactive relationship with the natural world. \r\nBorn in Philadelphia but transplanted to areas such as Camden, S.C., and Manhattan's Upper \r\nEast Side, Lloyd developed a compassion for her fellow man, an understanding about the efficacy \r\nof environmental protection and a generous spirit that has allowed her to help others. \r\nHer philanthropic endeavors have focused on projects that provide outlets for connecting people \r\nto their natural surroundings, thus engendering a better appreciation for the environment. Her \r\ngift of nearly $10 million to Clemson University-including an 852-acre parcel of land on the \r\nWateree River in Kershaw County to be used as an environmental education center as well as a $2 \r\nmillion cash gift to fund an endowed chair in urban ecology and restoration-epitomizes not only \r\nher generosity but also her integral understanding of the importance of environmental \r\nsustainability in the 21\" century. \r\nLloyd's interest in demonstrating and reinforcing to both children and adults the connections \r\namong all living things is the key element behind the environmental education program to be \r\ndesigned for the center. The program will also include formal lectures and seminars, and the site \r\nwill be home to a small model residential community in which the houses will be built in an \r\nenvironmentally sustainable manner. \r\nLloyd has accrued a long and noteworthy list of accomplishments that have helped to further \r\nenhance and mature her career. Her novel, Hortishland, was published in 2001 when she was 85. \r\nShe has devoted her time to organizations in New York City focused on world peace, eliminating \r\nhunger and humanitarian endeavors in Third World countries, including work at the United \r\nNations. However, her primary focus has been on ecology. \r\nIt is a most significant occasion when Clemson University honors such an influential individual \r\nwith an honorary degree in recognition of eminent achievement and meritorious contributions to \r\nthe institution, to the people of South Carolina and to the world. It is a distinct privilege to honor \r\nMargaret Hebard Lloyd with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities. "

        "text": "THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the \r\nUniversity. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a sen ior faculty member, with \r\nthe college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the \r\ndisciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on \r\nEducation, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval \r\norigin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes \r\nspecified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a \r\nuniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar \r\nboards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black \r\nor discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer \r\nthan bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves \r\nextended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and \r\nthe sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to \r\nreplace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, \r\ndegree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large \r\nand of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also \r\nconveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the \r\nthroat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy \r\n(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are \r\ndisplayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are duplicated by \r\ndozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by \r\ntheir professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped \r\nin gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three \r\nvelvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not \r\nhold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the \r\nUniversity Marshal. C lad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the \r\nUniversity mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, \r\nalong with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its \r\ndelegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into \r\nthe assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout \r\nthe ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is \r\nsymbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the \r\nproceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces \r\ncarried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, \r\nhowever, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of \r\nwalnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University \r\ncolors represented by insets of comelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is \r\nalso the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of \r\npresident by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may \r\nwear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's \r\nchain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of office\" \r\nwhich were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They \r\ndisplay the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the \r\ncollege belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. \r\nEbendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late \r\nProfessor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. \r\nWilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "HISTORICAL STATEMENT \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the \r\nbulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. \r\nHe had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as \r\nthe first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he \r\npublished numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His \r\nvaried activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural \r\nCollege, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil \r\nWar, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. \r\nMr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national \r\nshrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of \r\n446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major \r\nacademic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral \r\nScience, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and \r\nHuman Development, and the Graduate School. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \r\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education \r\nSpecialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be directed \r\nto Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 1866 \r\nSouthern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is also \r\navailable at sacscoc.org. \r\nCurricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American \r\nCouncil for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, American Society \r\nof Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), \r\nCouncil for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), \r\nNational Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and \r\nDesign, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPA/AALR \r\nCouncil on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American \r\nForesters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary \r\nacademic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five \r\nagricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily \r\ncommitted to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural \r\nextension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.
