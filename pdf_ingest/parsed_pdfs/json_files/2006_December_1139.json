        "text": "HISTORICAL STATEMENT \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left \r\nthe bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific \r\nagriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and \r\nagriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the \r\nMaryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South \r\nCarolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. \r\nMr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national \r\nshrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of \r\n446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six \r\nmajor academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business \r\nand Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of \r\nHealth, Education, and Human Development, and the Graduate School. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \r\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education \r\nSpecialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be \r\ndirected to Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, \r\n1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is \r\nalso available at sacscoc.org. \r\nCurricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance \r\nCollegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, \r\nAmerican Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, \r\nAmerican Society of Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing \r\nEducation (CCNE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education \r\nPrograms (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association \r\nof Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation, NRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, \r\nand Society of American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the \r\ncollege deans' offices. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary \r\nacademic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five \r\nagricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily \r\ncommitted to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural \r\nextension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nJ RICHARD SOSNOWSKI \r\nDOCTOR OF SCIENCE \r\nDr. J Richard Sosnowski is one of South Carolina's most distinguished physicians and a \r\nrecognized humanitarian who has unselfishly served his fellow man. \r\nA Lowcountry native of Wadmalaw Island, Dick Sosnowski graduated from Clemson with a B.S. \r\ndegree in 1942. He was an outstanding student leader, serving as a cadet battalion commander. As \r\na member of Blue Key, Tiger Brotherhood, the YMCA Council and Phi Kappa Phi Honor \r\nSociety, the Honor Military Graduate was recognized by Who's Who Among Students in \r\nAmerican Universities and Colleges. \r\nHe received his M.D. degree from the Medical College of South Carolina in 1945. Following a \r\none-year internship, he served two years in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, including a tour in \r\nKorea, then completed a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Roper Hospital in Charleston, \r\nfollowed by an endocrinology fellowship at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. \r\nDr. Sosnowski's life of leadership and service continued to grow following his return to \r\nCharleston in 1952. He entered a busy private medical practice and served as a part-time clinical \r\nfaculty member at MUSC, evolving into a popular teacher for generations of students. \r\nIn 1973, he undertook postgraduate study at the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, and in 1974, his \r\nlove of teaching led to a full-time faculty appointment in the College of Medicine at MUSC. He \r\nexcelled in teaching resident physicians and medical students and was much in demand speaking \r\nabroad and providing continuing education for Air Force chaplains. \r\nIn addition to serving as professor of obstetrics and gynecology, he devoted increasing amounts of \r\ntime to administration as associate and interim dean until his retirement in 1991 as vice dean. He \r\nmaintained a busy clinical practice and remained active in professional societies, community \r\norganizations and the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. \r\nDr. Sosnowski is known and respected as a man of superior intellect, keen judgment and sterling \r\ncharacter. Throughout his exceptional medical career, he focused on students and education. \r\nOver the years, he was a counselor for an untold number of students. He listened to every student \r\nwith ear, eye and heart, and at the same time quietly demanded each person's very best \r\nperformance. \r\nMUSC students made a tangible statement of their deep respect and admiration by presenting \r\nhim the Student Council President's Award in 1991. Recognized as a professor emeritus, he also \r\nreceived the Distinguished Alumnus Award at MUSC in 1990 and the Distinguished Faculty \r\nService Award in 1998. Clemson awarded him the Alumni Distinguished Service Award in 1971. \r\nIt is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of our own \r\nalumni with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievement and meritorious \r\ncontributions to his profession and his community. It is a distinct privilege to present the \r\nhonorary degree, Doctor of Science, to Dr. J Richard Sosnowski. "

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nROGER E STEVENSON \r\nDOCTOR OF SCIENCE \r\nDr. Roger E Stevenson has devoted his lifelong medical career to the study of birth defects and \r\ndevelopmental impairments. His dream: bringing the next generation closer to the goal of having \r\nall babies born healthy and free of physical and mental disabilities. \r\nThe concept took shape and eventually developed into the Greenwood Genetic Center in \r\nGreenwood, S.C., which Dr. Stevenson helped establish in 1974 and where he now serves as \r\ndirector and senior clinical geneticist. \r\nUnder his leadership, the Greenwood Genetic Center has been a leader in the delivery of genetic \r\nservices, committed to diagnosing genetic conditions; counseling individuals and families; \r\nresearching the causes of birth defects and genetic diseases; and educating health-care providers, \r\nteachers and the public about genetics. \r\nIn July 2005, Clemson University and Greenwood Genetic Center announced an initiative to \r\nmove South Carolina to the forefront in identifying the genetic causes of diseases and developing \r\nnew treatments. The partners have formed a Genetics Collaborative to increase research and \r\ndoctoral education in human genetics. They plan to invest nearly $15 million in the initiative, \r\nincluding construction of a graduate education center on the Greenwood campus. \r\nDiscoveries that come from this partnership could make Dr. Stevenson's dream of healthier \r\ngenerations come true. It could lead to new technologies that reduce susceptibility to birth defects, \r\npremature births, mental retardation, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes. \r\nThese conditions affect citizens in South Carolina at a disproportionately higher rate than other \r\nstates, exacting a high toll on both the state's physical and economic wellbeing. \r\nFurthermore, the discoveries that will emerge from the Genetics Collaborative hold the promise of \r\na new genetics and biotechnology industry in South Carolina that will fuel real job growth for our \r\nstate. \r\nAn adjunct professor of genetics and biochemistry at Clemson, Dr. Stevenson earned his M.D. \r\nfrom the Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University. He was a pediatric intern \r\nat N.C. Baptist Hospital and a pediatric resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital. After appointments \r\nas a research fellow in metabolism and as a fellow in genetics at Johns Hopkins University School \r\nof Medicine, Dr. Stevenson served as a pediatrics faculty member at the University of Texas \r\nMedical School. \r\nDr. Stevenson has contributed broadly to the literature on the cytogenetic, metabolic, molecular \r\nand environmental causes of human disabilities. He authored two editions of the textbooks The \r\nFetus and Newly Born Infant, Infiuences of the Prenatal Environment and Human Malformations and \r\nRelated Anomalies. With colleagues at the Greenwood Genetic Center, he co-authored the \r\ntextbook X-Linked Mental Retardation. \r\nClemson University holds Dr. Roger Stevenson's remarkable life of service and his commitment \r\nto leading the search to provide hope for every family at risk of genetic disease in the highest \r\nregard. It is with great honor and pleasure that we recognize him with the honorary degree, \r\nDoctor of Science. "

        "text": "THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the \r\nUniversity. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, \r\nwith the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the \r\ndisciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on \r\nEducation, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nA cad em ic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate facu lty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of \r\nmedieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear \r\ncostumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a \r\nuniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar \r\nboards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear \r\nblack or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are \r\nlonger than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have \r\nsleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet \r\npanels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one \r\nvariation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored \r\ngown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, \r\ndegree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite \r\nlarge and of a different shape. C lemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim \r\nalso conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form \r\nthe throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of \r\nphilosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The \r\ncolors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University \r\nhood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations \r\nare duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered \r\ncombination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by \r\ntheir professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars \r\npiped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with \r\nthree velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those \r\nwho do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are \r\npreceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no \r\nhood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the \r\nrecessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its \r\ndelegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President \r\ninto the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand \r\nthroughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the \r\nclose of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces \r\ncarried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, \r\nhowever, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of \r\nwalnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University \r\ncolors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is \r\nalso the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of \r\npresident by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may \r\nwear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. \r\nClemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of office\" \r\nwhich were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They \r\ndisplay the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the \r\ncollege belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the \r\nvarious disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. \r\nEbendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late \r\nProfessor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C C \r\nWilson of Clemson University. "
