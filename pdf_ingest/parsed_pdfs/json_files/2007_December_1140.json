        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nFRANK EDWARD LUCAS \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nAt the pinnacle of the architectural profession, Frank Edward Lucas, FAIA, models the impact \r\nof a Clemson graduate's lifetime of integrity and service. \r\nThe Charleston architect was inaugurated as the 45'h chancellor of the College of Fellows of the \r\nAmerican Institute of Architects (AJA), the first South Carolinian to hold the honor. He is \r\nserving in 2007 during the AIA's 150'h anniversary. \r\nFew architects have had as profound an impact on the Southeast as Lucas, co-founder and \r\nchairman of LSJP ASSOCIATES LTD. The firm has grown from a one-man company in 1963 \r\nto one of the largest architectural firms in the Southeast. With a staff of more than 250 and \r\noffices in Charleston, Columbia, Charlotte, Wilmington and Raleigh, LSJP has completed over \r\n$5 billion in architectural commissions. \r\nLSJP has received more than 175 local and national awards for design excellence from the \r\nAmerican Institute of Architects, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the S.C. Arts Commission \r\nand others. \r\nLucas is nationally known for contributions to his profession's licensure, examination and \r\nregulatory standards and procedures. In addition to AJA, he's held leadership roles in the \r\nCharleston Council of Architects, State Board of Architectural Examiners, National Council of \r\nArchitectural Registration Boards and other professional organizations. Lucas is a recipient of \r\nthe S.C. AIA's highest award, the Medal of Distinction, and was honored by the Charleston \r\nContractors Association as Architect of the Year. \r\nSince graduating in 1959 with a bachelor of architecture degree, and serving as a captain in the \r\nArmy Artillery, Lucas has contributed his time, talent and resources in a very profound and \r\nmeaningful way to Clemson University. A charter member of the Presidents Club and an \r\n!PT A Y member, he has served three terms as president of the Clemson Advancement \r\nFoundation for Design + Building. He was also on the University's Board of Visitors, the \r\nCollege of Architecture Advisory Council and the President's Advisory Council, and has shared \r\nhis expertise with students as a visiting lecturer for ethics, licensing law and professional \r\npractice. In 1992, he received the Clemson Alumni Distinguished Service Award. \r\nLucas is involved in numerous civic organizations devoted to the arts, historic preservation, \r\neducation and the economy. Among them: S.C. Chamber and Charleston Metro Chamber of \r\nCommerce, Hibernian Society, Girl Scouts of America, Charleston Arts and History \r\nCommission, S.C. Arts Foundation, Trident Technical College Foundation, Trident Economic \r\nDevelopment Authority and MUSC Health Sciences Foundation. He was recognized for his \r\ncontributions to the Charleston community in 1996 with the Joseph P. Riley Leadership Award. \r\nLucas is a real estate broker, developer, architect and co-owner of The Charleston City Market, \r\none of the most vibrant commercial areas in South Carolina. He is also a founding director of \r\nthe rapidly growing Community First Bank and Carolina Financial Corp. \r\nIt is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of our own \r\nalumni with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievement and \r\nmeritorious contributions to his profession, his community and his alma mater. It is a distinct \r\nprivilege to present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to Frank Lucas. "

        "text": "THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the \r\nUniversity. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with \r\nthe college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the \r\ndisciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on \r\nEducation, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval \r\norigin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes \r\nspecified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a \r\nuniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar \r\nboards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black \r\nor discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer \r\nthan bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves \r\nextended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and \r\nthe sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to \r\nreplace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, \r\ndegree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large \r\nand of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also \r\nconveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the \r\nthroat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy \r\n(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are \r\ndisplayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are duplicated by \r\ndozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by \r\ntheir professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped \r\nin gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three \r\nvelvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not \r\nhold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the \r\nUn iversiry Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the \r\nUniversity mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, \r\nalong with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its \r\ndelegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into \r\nthe assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout \r\nthe ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic \r\nof the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried \r\nby heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is \r\nmuch more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood \r\nand silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors represented \r\nby insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of \r\nSouth Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of \r\npresident by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may \r\nwear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's \r\nchain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of office\" which \r\nwere carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the \r\nseal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college \r\nbelongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. \r\nEbendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths \r\nof our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor \r\nMarshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of \r\nClemson University. "

        "text": "HISTORICAL STATEMENT \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the \r\nbulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School \r\nof Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; \r\nhowever, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern \r\nplanter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a \r\ncareer as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first \r\nSuperintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington ( 1860). As a scientist he published \r\nnumerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities \r\nincluded his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in \r\nfounding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a political \r\nfigure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. \r\nCalhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. \r\nThe first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented by \r\ntwo two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic units. \r\nThese are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the \r\nCollege of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment, and the Graduate School. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \r\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education \r\nSpecialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be directed \r\nto Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 1866 \r\nSouthern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is also \r\navailable at sacscoc.org. \r\nCurricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American \r\nCouncil for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, American Society of \r\nLandscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), Council for \r\nAccreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), National \r\nArchitectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and Design, \r\nNational Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPNAALR Council on \r\nAccreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American Foresters. \r\nDocumentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary \r\nacademic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five agricultural \r\nexperiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily committed to a \r\nvaried program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has \r\nprofessional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

Freeman \r\nWhere the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, \r\nWhere the Tigers play; \r\nHere the sons of dear old Clemson \r\nReign supreme alway. \r\nChorus \r\nDear old Clemson, we will triumph \r\nAnd with all our might, \r\nThat the Tiger's roar may echo \r\nO'er the mountain height. \r\nWe will dream of greater conquests, \r\nFor our past is grand, \r\nAnd her sons have fought and conquered \r\nEvery foreign land. \r\nWhere the mountains smile in grandeur \r\nO'er the hill and dale. \r\nHere the Tiger lair is nestling \r\nSwept by storm and gale. \r\nWe are brothers strong in manhood, \r\nFor we work and strive; \r\nAnd our alma mater reigneth \r\nEver in our lives.
