        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nROBERT SIMS CAMPBELL, JR. \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nRobert Sims Campbell, Jr. has been described by his wife, Betsy, as \"a man of vision.\" It \r\nis this vision-his ability to see the possibilities and make them happen-that has touched \r\nso many people at Clemson University. \r\nAfter graduating from Clemson in 1937 with a General Science degree in Geology, \r\nMr. Campbell began working full-time at his family business, Campbell Limestone \r\nCompany, in Gaffney. He became president of the company just three years later when his \r\nfather passed away. During World War II, he served as an Army officer in the Philippines \r\nand occupied Japan and was discharged with the rank of major. When he returned to South \r\nCarolina, he energetically devoted himself to turning his small family business into a \r\nthriving industry, one that eventually supplied most of the stone used to build the South \r\nCarolina section of I-85. His company merged with Vulcan Materials Company in 1968 to \r\nbecome one of the country's largest mining operations. His work as a conservationist during \r\nhis long career earned him much recognition. He retired as vice president of Vu lean \r\nMaterials in 1980. \r\nProfessionally and personally, Mr. Campbell has participated in many organizations \r\nand received numerous awards. He was on the Board of Directors of the National Crushed \r\nStone Association, served as senior warden at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in \r\nGaffney and was on the Board of Trustees at York Place Episcopal Home for Children. He \r\nreceived an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Limestone College in 1989 and was also \r\nnamed a life trustee of the college after serving 23 years on Limestone's board of trustees. \r\nIn 1987 Clemson presented him the Clemson Medallion, its highest public award, and in \r\n1998 Governor David Beasley presented him with the Order of the Palmetto. \r\nMr. Campbell served on the Clemson University Board of Trustees from 1956 to 1960. \r\nIn 1986 he and his wife donated more than $1 million to Clemson to establish the Bob \r\nCampbell Chair of Technical Communications. At the time, it was the largest gift the \r\nUniversity had ever received; it was also the first endowed chair of its kind in the country. \r\nMr. Campbell endowed the chair because he felt that college graduates should be able to \r\nexpress their thoughts clearly, regardless of their major. His foresight and contributions \r\nhave allowed Clemson to become a national leader in shaping the emerging field of \r\ntechnical communications. In fact, TIME magazine chose Clemson as its \"Public College \r\nof the Year\" in 2000 largely due to the University's excellence in teaching writing and \r\ncommunication skills. \r\nMr. Campbell's other great love at Clemson is his field of study, geology. In 1991 he \r\nserved on the College of Sciences Advisory Board. He continued his lifelong dedication to \r\nconservation when he established on campus both the Bob Campbell Geology Museum and \r\nthe Campbell Natural History Museum. \r\nAs a couple and through their personal foundations, Mr. Campbell and his wife have \r\nprovided significant financial support to more than 30 programs at Clemson. He once said, \r\n\"Clemson educated me to be what I am today, and whatever I was able to achieve, I did \r\nhere in South Carolina. This is an opportunity to give something back.\" Mr. Campbell's \r\nunique vision for Clemson's future helped make the University what it is today. \r\nIn recognition of his remarkable and creative contributions to Clemson University, it is \r\nwith great honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, \r\nto Robert Sims Campbell, Jr. "

She and her husband, Robert, have contributed to the \r\ndevelopment of more than 30 programs at Clemson through their individual contributions \r\nand foundations. \r\nMrs. Campbell, a Greenville native, received her B.A. from Furman University in 1938 \r\nand married that same year. Two years later, she and her husband began managing his \r\nfamily business, Campbell Limestone Company, in Gaffney, and worked together until \r\n1968 when the business merged with Vulcan Materials Company. Mr. Campbell continued \r\nto serve as vice president, while Mrs. Campbell began devoting time to her passion, \r\nworking with socially challenged children. \r\nFor many years Mrs. Campbell worked one-on-one with developmentally impaired and \r\nemotionally disturbed children. Through the Betsy Campbell Foundation, she has \r\nsupported many youth initiatives, including the Sprouting Wings Program at Clemson. \r\nThis creative after-school program in the S.C. Botanical Garden focuses on helping \r\nchildren succeed through connecting with nature. \r\nOne of her most far-reaching contributions to C lemson came in 1986 when she and her \r\nhusband donated over $1 million to establish the Bob Campbell Chair of Technical \r\nCommunications, the first endowed chair of its kind in the nation. She said at the time, \r\n\"We believe there is a real need for technical graduates to be able to communicate their \r\nideas in a few words that can be understood and remembered.\" The effect of this \r\nendowment has been significant, gaining Clemson national recognition as a leader in \r\ntechnical communications. This year, TIME magazine chose Clemson as its \"Public \r\nCollege of the Year\" in large part because it is \"on the cutting edge of the \r\ncommunications-across-the-curriculum movement.\" \r\nMrs. Campbell has received many awards for her years of service to various \r\norganizations. As an active leader in the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Gaffney, \r\nMrs. Campbell was presented the Henry B. Richardson Award at York Place Episcopal \r\nHome for Children. From 1993 to 1995, she served as a member of the Board of Trustees at \r\nYork Place. Limestone College presented her an Honorary Alumnus Award in 1990 anJ \r\nawarded her an Honorary Doctorate in Public Service in 1999. In 1998 Governor David \r\nBeasley presented her with the Order of the Palmetto. \r\nToday, Mrs. Campbell's devotion to Clemson is still strong. In 1997 she contributed to \r\nthe establishment of the Betsy Campbell Carriage House at the S.C. Botanical Garden. \r\nThe first Betsy M. Campbell Learning Symposium for Teachers was held in 1999. She \r\nrecently provided guidance and financial support to initiate a new opportunity to link the \r\nClemson Community Scholars Program to elementary school enrichment programs so that \r\nthe students can learn from one another. And in the fa ll of 2000, an organization she \r\nfounded-Campbell Young Leaders Corporation-funded community service scholarships \r\nat Clemson and Furman. \r\nIn recognition of these outstanding contributions to Clemson University, it is with \r\ngreat honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to \r\nBetsy McDavid Campbell.

He is a dedicated leader in the brick industry and a faithful alumnus \r\nof Clemson University. \r\nA native of Saluda, Mr. Edwards graduated from Clemson with B.S. and M.S. degrees in \r\nCeramic Engineering in 1956 and 1957. He was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, \r\nwhere he served as a navigator/bombardier in the Tactical Air Command from 1957 to \r\n1960. After his tour of duty, he moved to Kingsport, Tennessee, to join General Shale \r\nProducts as a research engineer. He was promoted to director of research in 1964. In 1977 \r\nMr. Edwards transferred to the corporate office in Johnson City, Tennessee, after a \r\npromotion to director of engineering and research. He was named to his current position of \r\nvice president of engineering and research in 1980. \r\nDuring his years at General Shale Products, Mr. Edwards has guided the technical \r\nefforts of the company through countless projects of modernization, including the \r\nimplementation of a single-layer kiln, the use of fly ash in concrete block and the \r\nconversion of the kilns from gas to coal. His groundbreaking research and publication on \r\nthe freeze-thaw durability of brick products led to the adoption of the current criteria for \r\ndurability from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). These criteria \r\nprotect homeowners and building owners of all income levels from frost deterioration of \r\nbrick. Under Mr. Edwards' guidance, General Shale has become one of the most \r\ntechnically proficient companies in the ceramic industry. \r\nDuring his career, he has been involved in a number of organizations, including \r\nASTM, the American Ceramic Society and the Brick Institute of America (now the Brick \r\nIndustry Association). Mr. Edwards was elected a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society \r\nin 1979 and received the ASTM Award of Merit in 1993. \r\nMr. Edwards has offered his leadership skills and generosity to Clemson in many ways. \r\nIn 1985, he was a member of a committee founding the Chad Health Trust Fund, which \r\ninitially supported the late Dr. Gil Robinson's research for the brick industry. He became a \r\nmember of the Executive Committee of the Center for Engineering Ceramic \r\nManufacturing in 1987 and later served as the committee chairman. He was chairman \r\nduring the crucial period when the Ceramic Center started the fund drive to build and \r\nequip the Bishop Ceramic Laboratory at Clemson Research Park. The majority of the \r\npledges were obtained during his tenure, and he was influential in raising a total of $2.8 \r\nmillion for the Bishop Lab. He was responsible for encouraging companies in the brick \r\nindustry to donate more than $950,000, and his company has contributed $450,000 over the \r\npast decade. Additionally, Mr. Edwards' influence was key to getting the Tile Council of \r\nAmerica to invest $1.l million in the Clemson Research Park. \r\nIn recognition of his extraordinary leadership and contributions to Clemson University, \r\nit is with great honor and pleasure that we present the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to \r\nJoseph Franklin Edwards.

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year \r\ncurricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the \r\nUniversity has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, \r\nForestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, \r\nthe College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and \r\nScience, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the \r\nGraduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation \r\nBoard for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American \r\nSociety of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, \r\nHuman Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for \r\nManagement Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National \r\nAssociation of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors \r\nof Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of \r\nTeacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, \r\nand Society of American Foresters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is \r\nalso heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
