HONORARY DEGREE 
MARGARET HEBARD LLOYD 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
Margaret Hebard Lloyd has succeeded in embodying the philosophy of Joseph Campbell to "follow 
one's bliss" through her nonconformist passions and philanthropic endeavors. A true Renaiss<1nce 
woman, Lloyd is honored today for her generosity, humility and unceasing vivacity. 
Through her lifelong campaign of intellectual pursuit, Margaret Lloyd has developed and 
supported the value of education for the purpose of improving oneself and one's surroundings. At 
a time when higher education for women was not supported, Lloyd persisted in self-education 
through literature, travel and observation, resulting in a vivid interest and expertise in many fields 
and a passion for philanthropy. 
Her esteem for learning with the purpose of influencing is exemplified in her fervor for speaking at 
national and international conferences and in her numerous projects designed to direct people 
toward a better interactive relationship with the natural world. 
Born in Philadelphia but transplanted to areas such as Camden, S.C., and Manhattan's Upper 
East Side, Lloyd developed a compassion for her fellow man, an understanding about the efficacy 
of environmental protection and a generous spirit that has allowed her to help others. 
Her philanthropic endeavors have focused on projects that provide outlets for connecting people 
to their natural surroundings, thus engendering a better appreciation for the environment. Her 
gift of nearly $10 million to Clemson University-including an 852-acre parcel of land on the 
Wateree River in Kershaw County to be used as an environmental education center as well as a $2 
million cash gift to fund an endowed chair in urban ecology and restoration-epitomizes not only 
her generosity but also her integral understanding of the importance of environmental 
sustainability in the 21" century. 
Lloyd's interest in demonstrating and reinforcing to both children and adults the connections 
among all living things is the key element behind the environmental education program to be 
designed for the center. The program will also include formal lectures and seminars, and the site 
will be home to a small model residential community in which the houses will be built in an 
environmentally sustainable manner. 
Lloyd has accrued a long and noteworthy list of accomplishments that have helped to further 
enhance and mature her career. Her novel, Hortishland, was published in 2001 when she was 85. 
She has devoted her time to organizations in New York City focused on world peace, eliminating 
hunger and humanitarian endeavors in Third World countries, including work at the United 
Nations. However, her primary focus has been on ecology. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University honors such an influential individual 
with an honorary degree in recognition of eminent achievement and meritorious contributions to 
the institution, to the people of South Carolina and to the world. It is a distinct privilege to honor 
Margaret Hebard Lloyd with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a sen ior faculty member, with 
the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science 
Engineering and Science

Academic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval 
origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes 
specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black 
or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer 
than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves 
extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and 
the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to 
replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy 
(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped 
in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three 
velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not 
hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the 
University Marshal. C lad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the 
University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout 
the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is 
symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the 
proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces 
carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, 
however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University 
colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is 
also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" 
which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They 
display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the 
college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. 
Wilson of Clemson University.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. 
He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as 
the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he 
published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His 
varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil 
War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. 
Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 
446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major 
academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the 
College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral 
Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and 
Human Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be directed 
to Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 1866 
Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is also 
available at sacscoc.org. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, American Society 
of Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), 
Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), 
National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and 
Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPA/AALR 
Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American 
Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five 
agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural 
extension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
