        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left \r\nthe bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris ( 1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of \r\na southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific \r\nagriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, \r\n1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in \r\nWashington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of \r\nmining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in \r\nthe founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, \r\nhis leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding \r\nClemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a \r\nnational shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six \r\nmajor academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the \r\nCollege of Health, Education, and Human Development, and the Graduate \r\nSchool. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the \r\nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, \r\nGeorgia 30033-4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, \r\nMaster's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are \r\naccredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, \r\nAmerican Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, \r\nAmerican Society of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation \r\nBoard, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs \r\n(CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of \r\nSchools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation, National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, NRPA/AALR \r\nCouncil on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of \r\nAmerican Foresters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at \r\nfive agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also \r\nheavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of \r\nagricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the \r\nState's counties.

The positive differences he has made to the economy, the \r\nenvironment and the community will be felt by scores of South Carolinians for many years \r\nto come. \r\nMr. Watanabe received his B.A. in economic policy from Hitotsubashi University in \r\nJapan and joined Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. in 1964. He was based in Japan until 1991 when \r\nhe transferred to Greenwood and was later promoted to vice president of corporate \r\nplanning and treasurer. He was named president of Fuji Photo Film Inc. in 1996 and \r\nsubsequently became senior adviser to the president in 2004, the position from which he \r\nretired in June. \r\nHis visionary leadership of Fuji has propelled the corporation to great prominence in North \r\nAmerica. Under Mr. Watanabe's leadership, the Fujifilm complex in Greenwood has \r\ngrown by more than $100 million a year for the past 10 years. What began as a single \r\nmanufacturing facility in 1989 is now seven state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, a \r\nresearch and development center and the largest Fujifilm distribution center in the world. \r\nThe company plays an integral part in the economic success and employment of residents \r\nof the Upstate, maintains a strong environmental focus minimally impacting its \r\nsurrounding area and promotes volunteerism among its employees. \r\nDedication to the betterment of South Carolina's communities and support of education \r\nare evident through the programs that Mr. Watanabe has championed or helped to \r\nimplement. Fuji has established scholarships at Clemson University, Lander University, \r\nthe University of South Carolina and Piedmont Technical College and contributed to the \r\nDrummond Center for Statesmanship at Erskine College. \r\nClemson University is fortunate to have an individual of Mr. Watanabe's stature and \r\npersonal integrity spearheading efforts ro foster mutual understanding and devel~p \r\nbeneficial relationships between the University and the Japanese business/industrial \r\ncommunity in South Carolina. Mr. Watanabe co-chairs the U .S. Japan Alliance with \r\nClemson and serves as a member of the President's Advisory Council. He was also \r\ninstrumental in establishing the Clemson University Fuji Film Ohnishi Endowment for the \r\nexchange program between C lemson and the University of Tokyo, fostering education and \r\ninternational awareness among South Carolina's youth. \r\nMr. Watanabe has twice served as president of the Japan America Association of South \r\nCarolina and is a member of the Southeast U.S.-Japan Association. A founding member of \r\nthe Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, he is also a member of the Advisory \r\nBoard of the S.C. World Trade Center, Greenwood CEO Roundtable, Greenwood Genetic \r\nCenter Advisory Council and Greenwood Rotary Club. \r\nMr. Watanabe's visionary leadership and commitment to the state and region have been \r\nrecognized by Gov. Mark Sanford with the 2005 Order of the Palmetto - South Carolina's \r\nhighest civilian award - and the 2003 S.C. State Ambassador for Economic Development \r\nAward. In 2004, he was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Partnership \r\nfor Greater Greenwood County and Economic Alliance and the Distinguished Service \r\nAward by the Pharo Marketing Association. \r\nClemson University holds Harry Watanabe's accomplishments and contributions to the \r\npeople of South Carolina in the highest regard.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a \r\nsenior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNu.rsing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes \r\nof medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United \r\nStates wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black \r\nand are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of \r\nmetallic threadi other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since l960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. \r\nWhile most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet \r\nin the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' \r\nlarger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most \r\nfrequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with chat registered \r\ncombination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as \r\nsec forth by their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown \r\nwith four velvet bars piped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The \r\nTrustees wear a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an \r\nembroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either \r\nfrom Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. \r\nAt the ceremony's close, che faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, \r\nalong with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the \r\nPresident into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the \r\nclose of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces \r\ncarried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, \r\nhowever, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made \r\nof walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the \r\nUniversity colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) and amethyst \r\n(purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office \r\nof president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and comelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of office\" \r\nwhich were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They \r\ndisplay the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which \r\nthe college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the \r\nvarious disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. \r\nEbendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late \r\nProfessor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. \r\nC. Wilson of Clemson University. "
