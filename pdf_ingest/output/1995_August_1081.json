        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nWYLMA ANNE WATES \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nSouth Carolinian Wylma Wates, an archivist of South Carolina's history and dedicated \r\npublic servant, has mentored a generation of scholars in history and has been instrumental in \r\nhelping to build the state's archives into one of the nation's best. Her story speaks of a life \r\noverwhelmingly devoted to her native state. \r\nShe was born at Olanta and educated at Olanta High School and Coker College. She \r\ntaught in the public schools for two years before pursuing graduate studies at Emory University, \r\nearning an M.A. degree in history in 1951. This academic preparation led her to a position with the \r\nS.C. Department of Archives and History as an editorial assistant. \r\nShe has spent most of her adult life as an historical specialist with the department in a \r\ncareer that spans 38 years (1952-1990). As a senior archivist, she was a mainstay for any scholar, \r\nstudent, or other individual doing research or publication on South Carolina history. \r\nVirtually every scholar who has written on the history of South Carolina and many of \r\nthose who have written on the history of the South, whether they were young graduate students or \r\nsenior scholars, has consulted Wylma Wates, and she has guided them to the rich documentary \r\nresources in the South Carolina Archives. \r\nShe is one of that small army of dedicated archivists without whom scholarship cannot \r\nproceed. Although Ms. Wates officially retired from the Department of Archives and History in \r\n1990, she continues to be active in the profession and frequently is consulted on matters of research. \r\nShe attends conferences and professional meetings and presently is writing a book on the Izard \r\nfamily of South Carolina, which is under contract with the University of Georgia Press. \r\nThrough her dedicated services, all who are interested in the history of the South and \r\nSouth Carolina have been made intellectually richer. Hundreds of authors have acknowledged her \r\nassistance in their works. \r\nHer numerous books and articles are all important contributions to the history of the \r\nPalmetto State. One article exemplifies the virtues that merit the honorary degree. \"Meanderings \r\nof a Manuscript: General Peter Harry's Collection of Francis Marion Letters\" appeared in volume \r\n81 (1980) of the Sou.th Carolina Historical Magazine . The article is less than 10 pages, but \r\nillustrates the power of the combination of a fine historical mind and long years of archival \r\nexperience. \r\nThe mystery that Wylma Wates solved in this piece is but one example of a long career \r\nof helping scholars and scholarship. Dr. Lewis Jones, author of a bibliography on South Carolina \r\nhistory, liked to say that one way to judge a new book in this field was to look at the \r\nacknowledgments. If Ms. Wates' name wasn't there, the author probably hadn't done his research \r\nwell. \r\nAt Clemson, she serves as an adjunct professor of history, lecturing periodically to \r\ngraduate and undergraduate classes. She also has guided graduate students through the \r\ncomplexities of the state's archives and serves as a constant resource for them in Columbia. \r\nShe was a participant in one of Clemson University's centennial events, reading a paper \r\nat the Fort Hill Conference on Southern Culture held in 1989. She contributed an essay, \"Precursor \r\nto the Victorian Age: The Concept of Marriage and Family as Revealed in the Correspondence of \r\nthe Izard Family of South Carolina,\" to a book that came out of this conference, In Joy and In \r\nSorrow : Women, Family, and Marriage in the Victorian Sou.th, 1830-1900, edited by Dr. Carol \r\nBleser of Clemson University and published by Oxford University Press in 1991. \r\nIt is indeed a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors \r\none of South Carolina's native daughters with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent \r\nachievement in scholarship and her genuine service to the scholarship of the greater academic \r\ncommunity of South Carolina. \r\nWe hold Wylma Wates and her lifetime achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a \r\ndistinct privilege to honor her with the presentation of the Doctor of Humanities.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, \r\nTrustees, and honored guests of the University. Faculty enter by college \r\nand each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, \r\nwith the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank \r\nwearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have \r\nreceived their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear \r\ncostumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United \r\nStates' institutions are specified by a uniform code maintained by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually \r\nmortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. \r\nMasters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns \r\nhave sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have \r\nsleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked \r\nby three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one \r\nvariation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A \r\nsecond variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and \r\nthe awarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the \r\nhood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large \r\nand of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. \r\nThe width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the \r\nthroat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which \r\ndesignates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of \r\nthe hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are \r\ndisplayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that \r\nthe Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an \r\norange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are duplicated by \r\ndozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that \r\nregistered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, \r\necclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by their professions. They \r\nare preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold \r\nand purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. \r\nAt the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the \r\nrecessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when \r\nthe marshal leaves the coliseum.

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of \r\nClemson University and must be present at any convocation where the \r\nUniversity, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any \r\nofficial convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, \r\ncarrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace \r\nrests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the \r\nceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, \r\nthus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the \r\nceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle \r\nAges. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably \r\ngoing back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, \r\nwith the seal of the University in gold and the University colors \r\nrepresented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). \r\nAmethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in \r\nthe office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for \r\nthe whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of \r\nsilver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \r\n\"staffs of office\" which were carried by the senior members of \r\ndepartments of state or church. They display the seal of the University \r\nand the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. \r\nClemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert \r\nEbendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of \r\nthe most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the \r\nbatons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the \r\nlapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson \r\nUniversity. "

        "text": "Coat of Arms \r\nDesigned by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, the \r\ncoat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this \r\ninstitution: teaching, research and service. \r\nPictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. The \r\nbottom contains a series of open books representing the concept of \r\nteaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the \r\nUniversity as it is achieved through undergraduate and graduate \r\ninstruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and \r\nwheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as \r\nwell as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three \r\nsymbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the \r\nhumanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a \r\nwhite tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas Green \r\nClemson's desire that Clemson become \"the people's university\" for \r\nSouth Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, orange, white and \r\ngold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official colors of \r\nthe University; the inner pair, orange and white, are Clemson's student \r\ncolors. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-\r\n1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the \r\nfounding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at \r\nthe Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was \r\nthat of a mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his \r\ninterests into politics and the life of a southern planter, and he soon \r\nbecame an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a \r\ncareer as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served \r\nas the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington \r\n(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of \r\nmining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his \r\nassistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his \r\nsupport of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the \r\nCivil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. \r\nCalhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half \r\nof the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved \r\non the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two \r\nfour-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. \r\nToday the University has five major academic units. These are the \r\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, the College of \r\nArchitecture, Arts and Humanities, the College of Engineering and \r\nScience, the College of Professional Studies, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association \r\nof Colleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the \r\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American \r\nAssembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Computing Sciences \r\nAccreditation Board, Council on Accreditations of the National \r\nRecreation and Park Association, National Architectural Accrediting \r\nBoard, National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and \r\nCertification, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, \r\nNational League for Nursing, and Society of American Foresters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in \r\nits primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main \r\ncampus and at five agricultural experiment stations located in the \r\nState. The University is also heavily committed to a varied program of \r\npublic service, including the work of agricultural extension which has \r\nprofessional personnel located in each of the State's counties.
