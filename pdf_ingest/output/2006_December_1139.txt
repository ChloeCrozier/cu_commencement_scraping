HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left 
the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the 
institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal 
School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining 
engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a 
southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific 
agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) 
and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and 
agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the 
Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. 
Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 
446. The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, 
supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six 
major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business 
and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of 
Health, Education, and Human Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Questions related to this accreditation should be 
directed to Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 
1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097; phone 404-679-4501. Information is 
also available at sacscoc.org. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance 
Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 
American Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association, 
American Society of Landscape Architects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing 
Education (CCNE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education 
Programs (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association 
of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education, NRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, 
and Society of American Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the 
college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five 
agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural 
extension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

HONORARY DEGREE 
J RICHARD SOSNOWSKI 
DOCTOR OF SCIENCE 
Dr. J Richard Sosnowski is one of South Carolina's most distinguished physicians and a 
recognized humanitarian who has unselfishly served his fellow man. 
A Lowcountry native of Wadmalaw Island, Dick Sosnowski graduated from Clemson with a B.S. 
degree in 1942. He was an outstanding student leader, serving as a cadet battalion commander. As 
a member of Blue Key, Tiger Brotherhood, the YMCA Council and Phi Kappa Phi Honor 
Society, the Honor Military Graduate was recognized by Who's Who Among Students in 
American Universities and Colleges. 
He received his M.D. degree from the Medical College of South Carolina in 1945. Following a 
one-year internship, he served two years in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, including a tour in 
Korea, then completed a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Roper Hospital in Charleston, 
followed by an endocrinology fellowship at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. 
Dr. Sosnowski's life of leadership and service continued to grow following his return to 
Charleston in 1952. He entered a busy private medical practice and served as a part-time clinical 
faculty member at MUSC, evolving into a popular teacher for generations of students. 
In 1973, he undertook postgraduate study at the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, and in 1974, his 
love of teaching led to a full-time faculty appointment in the College of Medicine at MUSC. He 
excelled in teaching resident physicians and medical students and was much in demand speaking 
abroad and providing continuing education for Air Force chaplains. 
In addition to serving as professor of obstetrics and gynecology, he devoted increasing amounts of 
time to administration as associate and interim dean until his retirement in 1991 as vice dean. He 
maintained a busy clinical practice and remained active in professional societies, community 
organizations and the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. 
Dr. Sosnowski is known and respected as a man of superior intellect, keen judgment and sterling 
character. Throughout his exceptional medical career, he focused on students and education. 
Over the years, he was a counselor for an untold number of students. He listened to every student 
with ear, eye and heart, and at the same time quietly demanded each person's very best 
performance. 
MUSC students made a tangible statement of their deep respect and admiration by presenting 
him the Student Council President's Award in 1991. Recognized as a professor emeritus, he also 
received the Distinguished Alumnus Award at MUSC in 1990 and the Distinguished Faculty 
Service Award in 1998. Clemson awarded him the Alumni Distinguished Service Award in 1971. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of our own 
alumni with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievement and meritorious 
contributions to his profession and his community. It is a distinct privilege to present the 
honorary degree, Doctor of Science, to Dr. J Richard Sosnowski.

HONORARY DEGREE 
ROGER E STEVENSON 
DOCTOR OF SCIENCE 
Dr. Roger E Stevenson has devoted his lifelong medical career to the study of birth defects and 
developmental impairments. His dream: bringing the next generation closer to the goal of having 
all babies born healthy and free of physical and mental disabilities. 
The concept took shape and eventually developed into the Greenwood Genetic Center in 
Greenwood, S.C., which Dr. Stevenson helped establish in 1974 and where he now serves as 
director and senior clinical geneticist. 
Under his leadership, the Greenwood Genetic Center has been a leader in the delivery of genetic 
services, committed to diagnosing genetic conditions; counseling individuals and families; 
researching the causes of birth defects and genetic diseases; and educating health-care providers, 
teachers and the public about genetics. 
In July 2005, Clemson University and Greenwood Genetic Center announced an initiative to 
move South Carolina to the forefront in identifying the genetic causes of diseases and developing 
new treatments. The partners have formed a Genetics Collaborative to increase research and 
doctoral education in human genetics. They plan to invest nearly $15 million in the initiative, 
including construction of a graduate education center on the Greenwood campus. 
Discoveries that come from this partnership could make Dr. Stevenson's dream of healthier 
generations come true. It could lead to new technologies that reduce susceptibility to birth defects, 
premature births, mental retardation, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes. 
These conditions affect citizens in South Carolina at a disproportionately higher rate than other 
states, exacting a high toll on both the state's physical and economic wellbeing. 
Furthermore, the discoveries that will emerge from the Genetics Collaborative hold the promise of 
a new genetics and biotechnology industry in South Carolina that will fuel real job growth for our 
state. 
An adjunct professor of genetics and biochemistry at Clemson, Dr. Stevenson earned his M.D. 
from the Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University. He was a pediatric intern 
at N.C. Baptist Hospital and a pediatric resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital. After appointments 
as a research fellow in metabolism and as a fellow in genetics at Johns Hopkins University School 
of Medicine, Dr. Stevenson served as a pediatrics faculty member at the University of Texas 
Medical School. 
Dr. Stevenson has contributed broadly to the literature on the cytogenetic, metabolic, molecular 
and environmental causes of human disabilities. He authored two editions of the textbooks The 
Fetus and Newly Born Infant, Infiuences of the Prenatal Environment and Human Malformations and 
Related Anomalies. With colleagues at the Greenwood Genetic Center, he co-authored the 
textbook X-Linked Mental Retardation. 
Clemson University holds Dr. Roger Stevenson's remarkable life of service and his commitment 
to leading the search to provide hope for every family at risk of genetic disease in the highest 
regard. It is with great honor and pleasure that we recognize him with the honorary degree, 
Doctor of Science.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, 
with the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows:

A cad em ic Support 
Instruction 
Collegiate facu lty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of 
medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear 
costumes specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear 
black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are 
longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have 
sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet 
panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one 
variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored 
gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite 
large and of a different shape. C lemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim 
also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form 
the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of 
philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The 
colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University 
hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations 
are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered 
combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars 
piped in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with 
three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those 
who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are 
preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no 
hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the 
recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 10
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand 
throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a 
convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the 
close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces 
carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, 
however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University 
colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is 
also the state stone of South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" 
which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They 
display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the 
college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the 
various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C C 
Wilson of Clemson University.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
