He is also known by many as a \r\nsavvy businessman, an individual deeply interested in the well-being of our communities \r\nand the state of South Carolina, and an ardent supporter of Clemson. \r\nMr. Dukes began his career at the Charleston Naval Yard after graduating from \r\nClemson at the top of his engineering class in 1938 with a B.S. in Electrical \r\nEngineering. One year later, he began work at General Electric as an engineer, where he \r\nworked for two years until World War II. \r\nIn July 1941, Mr. Dukes was called to active duty in the U.S. Army. He served for five \r\nyears, earning the Commendation Medal for Outstanding Service. He remained in the \r\nactive reserves for 22 years before retiring as a Colonel. \r\nAfter World War II, he co-founded Applied Engineering Company, Inc. in \r\nOrangeburg. The company became a leader in designing and manufacturing peak \r\nshaving plants for natural gas utilities as well as modular process systems for the \r\nchemical, petroleum and pharmaceutical industries. \r\nMr. Dukes remained as Vice President and President after the company was acquired \r\nby Daniel Construction in 1969 until retiring from Fluor Daniel in 1983. His professiona l \r\nassociations include membership in the American Gas Association, National Society of \r\nProfessional Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Eng ineers, American Institute \r\nof Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and South Carolina Forestry Association. \r\nAn example of service and loyalty, Mr. Dukes has contributed to organizations on \r\nnational, regional and community levels. He has served on a number of boards including \r\nthe First Federal S&L of Orangeburg, First Savings Bank of Greenville, American Red \r\nCross, United Way of Orangeburg, Orangeburg Technical College Foundation, Elk's \r\nClub, Still Hopes Home for the Aging, Diocese of South Carolina and Orangeburg's \r\nEpiscopal Church of the Redeemer. An ardent proponent of education, he has also served \r\non the Board of Trustees of Voorhees College and St. Mary's College. \r\nThroughout his successful career, Mr. Dukes' devotion to Clemson University has been \r\nunwavering. Following retirement, he and his wife, Peggy, have freely given their time \r\nand energy to the University. Mr. Dukes received the Alumni Distinguished Service \r\nAward in 1979 and served as President of the University Foundation in 1985-1986.

An agronomy \r\nmajor, he graduated with a B.S. in 1953. Following graduation, Mr. Lawson served as a \r\nDivision Ammunition Officer for the 69th Infantry Division as a First Lieutenant. \r\nSince his return to Darlington in 1955, Mr. Lawson has been actively engaged in \r\nfarming . With two of his sons, he owns and operates a diversified farming operation that \r\nproduces crops including tobacco, cotton, corn, soybeans, sweet potatoes, wheat and timber. \r\nCalled Lawson Farms, this family farm was established in 1834 by his great-grandfather. \r\nMr. Lawson has served as State Executive Director for the Farm Service Agency, U .S. \r\nDepartment of Agriculture since 1993. From 1979 to 1986 he was appointed by Governor \r\nRichard W. Riley to serve as Chairman of the S.C. Agriculture Commission. \r\nAmong Mr. Lawson's professional honors and awards, in 1982 he was named as one of 10 \r\noutstanding farmers in the United States by American Cyanamid Corporation. He \r\nreceived the Award of Recognition for his contribution to South Carolina agriculture in \r\n1983, Progressive Farmer Man of the Year Award in 1985 and S.C. Farm Bureau's \r\nDistinguished Service Award in 1986. In 1987 Mr. Lawson was recognized further for his \r\noutstanding contributions to agricu lture when he was awarded the Order of the Palmetto, \r\nSouth Carolina's highest honor, by Governor Riley. \r\nService to his church and to his community has always been a priority for Mr. Lawson. \r\nHe is actively involved with Trinity United Methodist Church in Darlington, where he is \r\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, Chairman of the Building Committee and Sunday \r\nSchool teacher. He has served as Chairman of the Epworth Children's Home Board of \r\nTrustees and is now serving a new eight-year term on this board. Service on a number of \r\nlocal and regional leadership boards includes the S.C. Farm Bureau Federation, Darlington \r\nCounty Farm Bureau, Kiwanis Club, NationsBank Advisory Board of Darlington and \r\nDarlington County School Board. \r\nC lemson University has remained a focus of Mr. Lawson's support and devotion. He was \r\nrecognized by the S.C. County Agents Association for his outstanding contribution to \r\nagriculture and C lemson University Extension Service in 1982. ln 1983 he was made an \r\nalumnus member of Clemson's Gamma Sigma Delta, the international honor society of \r\nag ricu lture, and was given a distinguished service award. He served as C lemson's delegate \r\nto the Commission on Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching from 1979 to 1993. \r\nA member of the Board of Directors of Clemson Agriculture Alumni since 1990, he served \r\nas President in 1996 and 1997. The C lemson Board of Visitors has benefited from his \r\ninsight and experience since 1991. \r\nHe is married to the former Elizabeth Banks Pearce, his wife of over 44 years. They have \r\nfour children, Marvin, Elizabeth, William and James, and eight grandchildren. \r\nWe are all extremely proud of the significant contributions Mr. Lawson has made to the \r\nfield of agricu lture, the state of South Carolina, and Clemson University. We hold Laurie \r\nLawson and his achievements in the highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor \r\nhim with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws. \r\n' "

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the banner bearers are the college marshals and faculty. Each banner is a \r\ncombination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which \r\nwere established by the American Council on Education, arc as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSoc ial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNu rsing \r\nSocia l Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions a re \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps a re \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tasse ls. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma llest, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph .D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson \r\nUniversity hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is presently the on ly \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military \r\nregalia as set forth by their professions. They arc preceded by the University Marshal. C lad \r\nin a gown of office in go ld and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the facu lty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of C lemson's mace is derived from the ceremonia l \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year \r\ncurricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the \r\nUniversity has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, \r\nForestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, \r\nthe College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and \r\nScience, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the \r\nGraduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation \r\nBoard for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on \r\nAccreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National \r\nArchitectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of \r\nTeacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of \r\nTeacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American \r\nForesters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is \r\nalso heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
