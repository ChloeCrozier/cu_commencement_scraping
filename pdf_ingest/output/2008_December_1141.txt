HONORARY DEGREE 
Benjamin Carroll Boozer 
Doctorate of Education 
Benjamin Carroll Boozer epitomizes the strength of character and generous spirit 
of outreach and community servic;e that C lemson University itself embodies. 
With more than 30 years as a community development specialist, including serving as director of C lemson's Institute for Economic and Community 
Development from 2000 to 2007, Boozer has helped to establish a statewide 
network of technical assistance, insightful guidance and leadership capacity 
development in communities all over South Carolina. 
Under his guidance, for the first time in our state's history, a collaborative group 
of state agencies, local government entities, other institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations and civic groups convened regularly to address challenges of rural communities in South 
Carolina. More significantly, this group developed strategies for pooling resources and outreach 
endeavors to provide assistance to these communities. 
As director of Clemson's Institute for Economic and Community Development, Boozer served as 
facilitator for strategic planning sessions in 28 S.C. communities, organized the S.C. Community 
Development Collaborative, directed the Main Street Program providing assistance to communities 
revitalizing their historic central commercial core, and coordinated work with the S.C. Design Arts 
Partnership and the Mayors' Institute in rural communities across the state. 
He has served on more than 10 economic development boards in South Carolina and is widely recognized as one of our state's leading experts on community development and as a premier facilitator 
in conducting strategic planning sessions and other community public meetings. 
A resident of Columbia and graduate of the University of South Carolina, Boozer served as executive 
director of the S.C. Downtown Development Association for 17 years prior to joining Clemson and 
was executive director of the Charleston County Parks, Recreation and Tourism Commission. 
He is the recipient of many community service awards, including the Order of the Palmetto, the 
Elizabeth O'Neill Verner Award from the S.C. Arts Commission, a Special Award from the S.C. 
Department of Education, the Rural Leadership Award from the S.C. Rural Development Council 
and the Allison Furlow Award from the Municipal Association of South Carolina. 
Ben Boozer's philosophy of service is embodied in these comments he made to a state conference: "If 
we believe the future of South Carolina is tied irrevocably to the future of its communities, then we 
must come together to leverage scarce resources and eliminate duplication of services and assistance. 
More importantly, we must recognize the interrelationships of issues and agencies and build a collaborative approach. Nothing less will enable South Carolina to remain competitive and viable." 
Clemson University holds Ben Boozer's remarkable life of service and his support of and commitment to the people of South Carolina in the highest regard. It is with great honor and pleasure that 
we recognize Benjamin Carroll Boozer with the honorary degree, Doctorate of Education.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that 
declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on Education, 
are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a uniform 
code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline 
color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. 
Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is 
indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, 
which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding 
institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University 
hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from C lemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson University 
and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its delegated 
members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, the 
university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president into the assembly. The 
mace rests before the president's chair or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, 
and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the clo~e of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried 
by heads of the state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, 
is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut 
wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the university colors represented by 
insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of 
South Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the university president may wear 
it, and while wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office," which 
were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the 
university seal and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various disciplines 
inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C C 
Wilson of Clemson University.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson ( 1807-1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the state of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School 
of Mines in Paris (1828-183 2). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; 
however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern 
planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had 
a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the 
first superintendent of agricultural affairs in W~shington (1860). AB a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied 
activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, 
his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, 
and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a South Carolina political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. 
Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. 
The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented 
by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences; the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities; the College of Business and Behavioral Science; 
the College of Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and Human 
Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the bachelor's, master's, education 
specialist, and doctor's degrees. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association (CADE), American 
Society ofLandscapeArchitects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ( CCNE), 
Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), 
National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and 
Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPN AALR 
Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American 
Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five agricultural 
experiment stations located in the state. The University is also heavily committed to a 
varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension, which 
has professional personnel located in each of the state's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/ arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
