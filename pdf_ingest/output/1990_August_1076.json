        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nDOCTOR OF LAWS \r\nJOHN D. ARCHBOLD \r\nJohn D. Archbold has had a distinguished career as an engineer, inventor, philan\u0002thropist, and conservationist. He has been awarded many honors, both national and \r\ninternational, during his remarkable lifetime. \r\nAn avid sailor, adventurer, and world traveller, he has developed a strong interest \r\nin the preservation of tropical ecosystems and tropical cultures and has devoted much \r\nof his energy to these efforts in recent years. \r\nIn May 1989, Mr. Archbold donated his beloved Springfield Plantation on the Carib\u0002bean island of Dominica to Clemson University. Springfield Plantation consists of 200 \r\nacres and nearly 30,000 square feet of lodging and storage space. \r\nThis generous gift formed the basis for the newly created Archbold Tropical \r\nResearch Center, a consortium of 10 universities and agencies dedicated to research \r\nand education concerning tropical ecosystems. Mr. Archbold's gift is helping Clemson \r\nmove to the forefront in the study of global environmental problems. \r\nMr. Archbold, who serves as honorary chairman of the consortium board, was \r\nborn in the picturesque port town of Bar Harbor, Maine, son of an Irishman and the \r\ngrandson of the first chief executive officer of Standard Oil of New Jersey. As a young\u0002ster he attended the Choate School in Connacticut, going on to study mechanical \r\nengineering at the University of Geneva and at Princeton University. He invented and \r\npatented a rotary internal combustion engine. \r\nMr. Archbold first came upon Dominica in 1935 while searching for a priceless \r\nColombian treasure at sea. He was twenty-four years of age and decided to enter \r\nDominica's planter business primarily as a producer of citrus. He bought land on the \r\nisland, where he developed a plantation and hotel complex. \r\nA large area of the plantation, Middleham Estates, was maintained as a pristine \r\ntropical rain forest. In 1975 he donated approximately 1,000 acres of this land to the \r\nNature Conservancy. This land, now known as the Archbold Preserve, contributed to \r\nthe establishment and expansion of the Morne Trois Pitons National Park on Dominica, \r\none of the very few misty forest preserves in the Caribbean. \r\nBecause of these accomplishments, Mr. Archbold was awarded the Order of the \r\nBritish Empire. He also received the SISSEROU Award, the highest order given by the \r\nGovernment of Dominica to a private citizen for distinguished public service in agri\u0002culture. \r\nMr. Archbold's interest in Dominica and tropical ecology led him to support many \r\nyears of research on the flora and fauna of the island by the Smithsonian Institution. \r\nThis has led to the publication of more than 60 scientific works totaling more than \r\n1,500 published pages. \r\nMembers of the new consortium are Clemson, the University of the West Indies, \r\nMedical University of South Carolina, University of Georgia, Texas A&M University, \r\nSyracuse University/SUNY-ESF, Yale University, U.S. Forest Service, National Park \r\nService, and the Smithsonian Institution. \r\nGiven his career of philanthropy, his dedication to the promotion of research and \r\neducation, his long involvement in conservation, and the high honors of recognition \r\nbestowed upon him by foreign governments, the awarding of an honorary Doctor of \r\nLaws degree from Clemson University is a most appropriate and timely action.

Bannon, Jr.'s sincere interest in Clemson University and his generous \r\nservice as a donor and volunteer leader place him among this institution's most \r\nappreciated supporters. \r\nMr. Bannon, a 1965 graduate, and his wife, DeeGee, live in Arlington, Texas, where \r\nhe is vice president of Azon Corporation. Their roots, however, are in South Carolina, \r\nfor both are Greenville natives and have families here in the Upstate. Their son, James \r\nG. \"Trey\" Bannon, Ill, is a 1989 Clemson graduate. \r\nThe Bannons are benefactors of the Jim and DeeGee Bannon Scholarship Endow\u0002ment, having personally committed $100,000 to generate unrestricted scholarships for \r\nClemson students.

McAbee is a strong \r\nadvocate of and key adviser to Clemson's public service programs and activities. He \r\nunderstands the vital importance of agriculture and natural resources to our economy, \r\nand he is aware that economic pro(lress is highly dependent upon the information \r\nderived through research and provided to our citizens through instruction and exten\u0002sion programs. \r\nRep. McAbee is a 1967 graduate of Wofford College, where he became a member \r\nof Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He began his legislative career in 1975, before \r\nwhich he served as county magistrate from 1970 until 1972. \r\nHe contributes to his community as a 32nd Degree Mason and as a member of the \r\nExchange Club, American Legion, Moose Lodge, Shriners, Jaycees and Lions Club. \r\nHe is a former chairman of the Cancer Society and of the Boy Scout Fund and is an \r\nactive member of the South Carolina National Guard. \r\nFor his service to our state, its citizens and higher education, Clemson University \r\nis pleased to present The President's Award to Rep. Jennings McAbee. "

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its mar\u0002shal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of \r\ncolors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were estab\u0002lished by the American Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Discipline \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic cos\u0002tumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is 1o replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the univer\u0002sity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' lar\u0002ger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Finally, \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that reg\u0002istered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military re\u0002galia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in \r\na gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the Presi\u0002dent into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close \r\nof a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, \r\nthe close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club\u0002like shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's pre\u0002history. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in \r\ngold and the University colors represented by insets of corneiian (orange) and \r\namethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the \r\nlate Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late \r\nMr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

The bottom contains a series of open \r\nbooks representing the concept of teaching as the ba\u0002sis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teach\u0002ing mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets \r\nof calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measure\u0002ment system for research, as well as Clemson's tradi\u0002tion in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -\r\nthe books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also repre\u0002sent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange cen\u0002ter shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the \r\nabiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes \r\nThomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become \r\n\"the people's university\" for South Carolinians. It rises \r\nfrom a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The \r\nouter pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official \r\ncolors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical State1nent \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agri\u0002culture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, \r\nand agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of \r\nthe Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership \r\nin South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, \r\na political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Col\u0002leges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural \r\nAccrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, \r\nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for \r\nEngineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus \r\nand at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University \r\nis also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
