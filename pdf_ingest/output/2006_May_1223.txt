HONORARY DEGREE 
RICHARD A. MCMAHAN 
DOCTOR OF HUMANITIES 
When Richard A. McMahan graduated from Clemson in 1954, not only had he earned a degree 
in architecture, he had accomplished much more as a student. 
From ROTC to Blue Key, student athlete to cheerleader, student government to TAPS editor, 
McMahan made invaluable contributions throughout his years at Clemson. 
He pursued life after Clemson in a similar way, working hard to build a career and just as hard to 
serve. Following a two-year stint in the U.S. Army just after graduation, the Columbia, South 
Carolina, nativ<> moved to Deland, Florida, to begin his career in construction. 
In 1966, he founded McMahan Construction Co. Inc., a contracting firm that specialized in 
water and wastewater treatment plants and underground utilities. With clients throughout 
Florida, the company grew into a multimillion-dollar operation. He also founded West Volusia 
Utilities, a company providing water and sewer services for a large portion of West Volusia 
County. He went on to develop other businesses including RAM Group Inc., a land 
development and investment company. 
All the while McMahan has served his community, state and country with distinction. In the 
early 1990s, he represented the 26'h District in the Florida House of Representatives and was 
recognized as the Top Freshman Legislator of the Year for Florida. 
McMahan has been involved in numerous civic programs and community enrichment projects 
including city and county planning boards and several arts-related boards. He has served as 
chairman of the Volusia County Business Development Corp., president of the YMCA and 
director of the chamber of commerce. A former member of the Deland Jaycees and director of 
Rotary International, McMahan is a Paul Harris Fellow. 
McMahan's service as a trustee of Stetson University, where he is in charge of new construction 
on the campus and provides student scholarships, earned him the Doyle T. Carlton Award for 
extraordinary contributions to the university, the city of Deland and the state of Florida. 
Throughout his successful career and civic involvement in Florida, McMahan has been a strong 
and loyal supporter of his alma mater. He has served on the Clemson University Foundation 
board of directors and supported academics through major giving. He's a member of the Thomas 
Green Clemson Society and the C lemson Legacy, those who've included Clemson in their wills. 
He established the Richard A. McMahan Presidential Scholarship in 1992, and because of his 
generous endowment in 1998, the University was able to establish the highly competitive 
Clemson National Scholars program. 
The Richard A. McMahan Fund for Excellence in Architecture, established in 2001, provides 
for annual faculty support, undergraduate scholarships, fellowships, a visiting architects program, 
technology support, faculty development and other projects. 
It is a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes and honors one of its own 
sons with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent achievements and meritorious 
contributions to the institution and to his community. It is a distinct privilege to honor Richard 
A. McMahan with the presentation of the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the 
University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with 
the college baton, described under University Regalia. 
The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is 3 combination of colors that declare the 
disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are as follows: 
College 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life 
Sciences 
Architecture, Arts, and 
Humanities 
Business and Behavioral Science 
Engineering and Science

Instruction 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval 
origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United StateS wear costumes 
specified by the awarding institutions. 
The academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar 
boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black 
or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer 
than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves 
extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and 
the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to 
replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the 
university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, 
degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large 
and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also 
conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the 
throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy 
(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are 
displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined 
with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are duplicated by 
dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by 
their professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped 
in gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three 
velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not 
hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the 
University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the 
University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, 
along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. 

Page 8
THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson 
University and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its 
delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as 
commencement, the University Marshal, cartying the mace, precedes the President into 
the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout 
the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic 
of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried 
by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is 
much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood 
and silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors represented 
by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of 
South Carolina. 
The Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may 
wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office" which 
were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the 
seal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various 
disciplines inset with enamel. 
The University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. 
Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths 
of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor 
Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of 
Clemson University.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School 
of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; 
however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern 
planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a 
career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington ~ 1860). As a scientist he published 
numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities 
included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support 
of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in 
founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a 
political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. 
Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. 
The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented by 
two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic units. 
These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the College of 
Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral Science, the 
College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human 
Development, and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-
4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education 
Specialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are accredited by the AACSB 
International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology, American Council for Construction Education, 
American Dietetic Association, American Society of Landscape Architects, Computing 
Science Accreditation Board, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related 
Education Programs (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National 
Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
Education, National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, NRPA/AALR 
Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American 
Foresters. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five agricultural 
experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily committed to a 
varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural extension which has 
professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

CLEMSON ALMA MATER 
Farmer and McGarity/arr. Freeman 
Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness, 
Where the Tigers play; 
Here the sons of dear old Clemson 
Reign supreme alway. 
Chorus 
Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
O'er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
O'er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
