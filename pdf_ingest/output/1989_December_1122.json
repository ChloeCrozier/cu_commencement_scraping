        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nGEORGE C. CHAPLIN \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nClemson alumnus and South Carolinian George Chaplin, editor-at-large of \r\nThe Honolulu Advertiser is one of the most highly respected journalists to come \r\nout of the institution. He enjoys both a national and international reputation in his \r\nfield. \r\nAs a young cadet in the early 1930s, Mr. Chaplin was majoring in chemistry \r\nand reporting for The Tiger. He was encouraged to put away his test tubes and \r\npursue a career in the written word because his special flair for writing had not \r\ngone unnoticed by John D. Lane, who was faculty adviser to the student news\u0002paper. Professor Lane taught English and was beloved by countless students. Mr. \r\nChaplin remflmbers Professor Lane telling him one day that \"he probably had set \r\nchemistry back a couple of centuries.\" But Chaplin also credits Professor Lane \r\nas \"the person more than anyone else who set me in the direction my life has \r\ntaken.\" \r\nBorn in Columbia, Mr. Chaplin moved to Greenville with his family when he \r\nwas about 14 years old. He earned his undergraduate degree at Clemson, where \r\nhe was editor of The Tiger and was a cadet lieutenant colonel of the cadet corps. \r\nHe graduated in 1935. \r\nMr. Chaplin's full-time career as a journalist began in nearby Greenville with \r\nthe Piedmont. At age 26, when he was a city editor of the Piedmont, he was re\u0002cipient of a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1940-41. He first went to \r\nHawaii in the Army in World War 11 as the founding editor and officer-in-charge \r\nof the Pacific edition of The Stars and Stripes, the armed forces newspaper. \r\nHe later worked on newspapers in Camden, New Jersey, San Diego and New \r\nOrleans (where he was editor of the Daily Item from 1949 to 1958) betore moving \r\nto Hawaii to begin his long association with The Honolulu Advertiser, Hawaii's \r\nprize-winning newspaper. When he was elected president of the American Society \r\nof Newspaper Editors thirteen years ago, he was the first editor outside the con\u0002tinental United States to be so honored. \r\nAfter a distinguished career which spanned 52 years, 28 of them with The \r\nAdvertiser, he retired as editor-in-chief on December 1, 1986 and remains as \r\neditor-at-large. During his tenure at the editorial helm, The Advertiser won more \r\nthan 60 national awards. Mr. Chaplin himself also has received many writing \r\nawards. Among his current writing projects is a biography of the 133-year-old \r\nnewspaper where he spent much of his career. \r\nTwo years ago Mr. Chaplin founded and raised $200,000 for the Coalition for \r\na Drug-Free Hawaii, a respected non-profit, private-sector program aimed at the \r\nyoung, their parents, and people in the workplace. He also has worked for many \r\nyears to improve relations between the United States and Japan. In recognition \r\nof this, the government of Japan conferred upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. \r\nHis biographical sketch has for years been included in \"Who's Who in America\" \r\nand \"Who's Who in the World.\" \r\nClemson University holds him and his lifetime achievements in the highest \r\nregard. It is a privilege for all of us to honor an individual who has contributed so \r\nmuch to the cause of a free press and to the building of stronger relationships \r\namong nations through his humanitarian initiatives.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its mar\u0002shal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nF:Jllowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of \r\ncolors that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were estab\u0002lished by the American Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Discipline \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic cos\u0002tumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelors' gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the univer\u0002sity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' lar\u0002ger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to \r\nbachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the discipline is \r\nindicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. Final!)', \r\nthe color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\" ). Although many combinations are \r\nduplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that reg\u0002istered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military re\u0002galia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University marshal. Clad in \r\na gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the\u00b7 University, through \r\nits delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the Presi\u0002dent into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's \r\nstand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close \r\nof a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, \r\nthe close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club\u0002like shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's pre\u0002history. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University in \r\ngold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) and \r\namethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the University \r\nPresident may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the \r\ninstitution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian \r\nand amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed \r\ngoldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the \r\nlate Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late \r\nMr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

The bottom contains a series of open \r\nbooks representing the concept of teaching as the ba\u0002sis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teach\u0002ing mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets \r\nof calipers and wheat sheaves illustrating the measure\u0002ment system for research, as well as Clemson's tradi\u0002tion in agriculture and Extension. The three symbols -\r\nthe books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also repre\u0002sent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange cen\u0002ter shield bearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the \r\nabiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes \r\nThomas Green Clemson's desire that Clemson become \r\n\"the people's university\" for South Carolinians. It rises \r\nfrom a band of purple, orange, white and gold. The \r\nouter pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official \r\ncolors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite. are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agri\u0002culture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-1852) \r\nand served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). \r\nAs a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, \r\nand agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the founding of \r\nthe Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership \r\nin South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, \r\na political figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of Col\u0002leges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National Architectural \r\nAccrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of American Foresters, \r\nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Board for \r\nEngineering and Technology, and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher \r\nEducation. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus \r\nand at five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University \r\nis also heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
