He has greatly contributed to the social and \r\neconomic growth not only of Japan, but also to that of South Carolina. \r\nMr. Ohnishi joined Fujifilm shortly after graduating from Tokyo University in 1948. \r\nHis degree in economics coupled with his love of photography led to many early Fujifilm \r\nsuccesses, including the introduction of the world's first Quick Snap one-time use \r\nrecyclable camera, the manufacturing of ISO 400 color negative film and the \r\ndevelopment of the digital medical diagnosis system. \r\nMr. Ohnishi was named manager of Fujifilm's New York office in 1964. In 1972, he \r\nbecame director of the board for the company and, after successful stints as both managing \r\ndirector and senior managing director, he was named president of Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. \r\nin 1980. \r\nIn this role, Mr. Ohnishi made the decision to build the first Fujifilm factory in the \r\nUnited States in Greenwood, S.C., which opened in 1989. In 1996, Mr. Ohnishi was named \r\nchairman and CEO of Fuijifilm's global operations and continues to implement his vision \r\nof a strong international commercial partnership throughout North America and the \r\nworld. \r\nThe Greenwood community embraced Fujifilm, and the partnership has flourished. \r\nFujifilm-Greenwood now has six major production facilities, a major research and \r\ndevelopment center and the largest Fujifilm distribution center in the world. The \r\nGreenwood complex is recognized as Fujifilm's North American manufacturing and R&D \r\nheadquarters. Fujifilm has helped strengthen our state's economy, with more than 1,300 \r\nassociates employed in South Carolina and an annual payroll approaching $50 million. \r\nIn 1997, Fujifilm made a contribution of $200,000 to help create the Greenwood \r\nCommunity Children's Center. The company has also given 100 cherry trees to \r\nGreenwood and has established scholarship programs at Clemson University, the \r\nUniversity of South Carolina, Lander University and Piedmont Technical College for the \r\nbenefit of Greenwood County students. \r\nFujifilm and Clemson have partnered to form the U.S.-Japan Alliance with Clemson, \r\nan organization that furthers international relations through research and industry. The \r\nties run strong: Mr. Hirokuni \"Harry\" Watanabe, president of Fujifilm's Greenwood \r\noperations and co-chair of the UJAC, serves as a member of the Commission on the Future \r\nof Clemson University, and Mr. Bill West, a Fujifilm-Greenwood's vice president of \r\nmanufacturing, serves on the Advisory Board of the Industrial Engineering Department. \r\nFurther, Fujifilm has had 23 Clemson co-op students since 1992 and recently enlisted \r\nseveral industrial engineering students to help address concerns related to process issues. \r\nIn recognition of his contributions to the international partnership between the United \r\nStates and Japan, to the state and constituency of South Carolina, and to the betterment of \r\nhis communities and educational institutions, it is a distinct privilege to present Mr. \r\nMinoru Ohnishi with our first foreign national honorary degree, the Doctor of Laws.

He later volunteered for duty in Vietnam, serving in \r\ncombat and earning the distinguished Bronze star with \"Y\" for \"courage under fire and \r\ninspiring leadership.\" After receiving a law degree from the University of South Carolina \r\nunder the Navy's Excess Leave Program, he furthered his service to our country through \r\nvarious assignments of increasing responsibility leading to over 10 years at the Pentagon. \r\nRear Admiral Schachte later received a Master of Laws degree in international law with \r\nhighest honors from the George Washington University Law School. \r\nAn authority on the law of the sea, Rear Admiral Schachte has served as Department of \r\nDefense Representative for Ocean Policy Affairs, in which capacity he was senior \r\nspokesman for the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \r\nRear Admiral Schachte demonstrated his skills in international diplomacy in law of the \r\nsea negotiations that ended in resolution of complex and sensitive issues with Russia, \r\nCanada, Greece, Turkey, Japan, and several Latin American and South Pacific nations. In \r\nacknowledgement of his diplomatic successes and his expertise in international ocean \r\nmatters, he was nominated by the Department of Defense to represent the United States at \r\nthe law of the sea tribunal in Hamburg, Germany. \r\nIn his final military post as Acting Judge Advocate General of the Navy, he served as \r\nthe senior uniformed lawyer in the Navy and Marine Corps, as personal legal and policy \r\nadviser to the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant \r\nof the Marine Corps. \r\nOver his outstanding record of service to our country, he has earned numerous personal \r\nawards, including the highest peacetime awards from both the Department of Defense and \r\nDepartment of the Navy, and he has received the prestigious Legion of Merit award twice. \r\nAs a testimony to his religious faith, Rear Admiral Schachte was the keynote speaker at \r\nthe 1995 Annual Mayor's Prayer Breakfast in Augusta, Ga. He was also the keynote \r\nspeaker at the largest Mayor's Prayer Breakfast in America. \r\nRear Admiral Schachte's leadership service to Clemson University began early at \r\nClemson. As a student, he served as president of both his freshman and sophomore classes \r\nand went on to serve as president of the Student Senate. He also served as news editor of \r\nthe Tiger, vice president of the Tiger Brotherhood, first president of the Interfraternity \r\nCouncil and president of Sigma Alpha Zeta, the first social fraternity at Clemson. \r\nAdditionally, he was elected senator and later governor of the South Carolina State \r\nStudent Legislature. \r\nRear Admiral Schachte continues to serve the University as a member of the College of \r\nArchitecture, Arts and Humanities Advancement Board and as a Legislative Advocate. \r\nWe hold Rear Admiral William L. Schachte and his lifetime achievements in the \r\nhighest esteem. In recognition of his remarkable service to the United States of America \r\nand his contributions to Clemson University, it is a distinct privilege to present him with \r\nthe Doctor of Laws honorary degree.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Am and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson \r\nUniversity hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military \r\nregalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand comelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the bacons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the lace Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year \r\ncurricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today \u00b7the \r\nUniversity has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, \r\nForestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, \r\nthe College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and \r\nScience, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the \r\nGraduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation \r\nBoard for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business, Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, Council on \r\nAccreditations of the National Recreation and Park Association, National \r\nArchitectural Accrediting Board, National Association of State Directors of \r\nTeacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of \r\nTeacher Education, National League for Nursing, and Society of American \r\nForesters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is \r\nalso heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.

The \r\ncontributions she made to students, colleagues and the future of C lemson are immeasurab le \r\nand resonate in the lives she personally touched and in those who never knew her but feel \r\nher impact today. \r\nDean Delony received her bachelor's degree in 1945 from Auburn University and her \r\nmaster's from Cornell Un ive rsity in 1951. She followed her fo rmal e<lucation with summer \r\nstudies at Michigan State and the Teachers College of Columbia University. \r\nHer first appointment in Academe was as an instructor at the Woman's College of North \r\nCaro lina, fo llowed by assistant professorships at Montana State Co llege and A uburn \r\nUniversity. Dean Delony became the assistant dean of women at Auburn in 1957 an<l \r\nremained there until 1963 when she was hired as the first dean of women at C lemson. For 14 \r\nyears, she served in this post and was later promoted to associate dean of students. \r\nWhen Dean Delony joined C lemson's ranks, there was a great need for programs, \r\nopportunities and fac ilities fo r women. (They had been admitted to C lemson only yea rs \r\nbefore, in 1955.) Dean Delony met this challenge with resolve and passion. During her \r\ntenure, she was instrumental in the format ion and development of the Resi<lence H a 11 \r\nProgram for women and the Resident Assistant Program. In 1969, she brought nat io nal \r\nwomen's socia l fraternities to C lemson, establishing the foundat ion fo r the successful Greek \r\nLife the University enjoys today. She helped fou nd Alpha Lamba Delta freshman honor \r\nsoc iety as well as Mortar Board. President Emeritus Walter Cox has ca lled hiring Dean \r\nDelany \"one of the best recommendations I made in my tenure at C lemson.\" \r\nIn add ition to her achi evements at the University, Dean Delony has provi<led \r\noutstand ing service to her community. While enjoy ing retirement in her birthplace of \r\nTuscumbia, Alabama, she retains active membership in her church and has served on a \r\nfeasibility study for the Consolidation Committee of Tuscumbia. She is past presi<lent nf the \r\nMaud Lindsay Study Club, volunteer of the Tennessee Valley Art Association Guild a nd \r\nhas served and is currently on the Board of Friends of the Helen Keller Public Library. \r\nDean Delony has made it her life's work to establish a high stan<lard nf characte r and \r\nvision for all with whom she has contact. Her spirit pervades the campus each and every <lay \r\nthe University thrives. It is with great honor and pleasure that we recognize this individual \r\nwho truly made a difference in the lives of stu<lents and of this University <luring a c ritical \r\ntime in its history. We hereby present Susan Goo<lwin Delony with the honorary Doctor of \r\nHuman ities degree. "

For over 50 years, he has served Clemson University in numerous \r\ncapacities-from the Clemson Little Theatre to the Social Committee of Clem on \r\nCollege to being a charter member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He has contributed not only \r\nto Clemson University, but to tens of thousan<ls of students who now define the cultural, \r\nsocial an<l educational fabric of America. \r\nProfessor Bob Nowack, or P.B. as he is better known, received his bachelor's <legree from \r\nCarnegie Mellon and a master's from the University of Pittsburgh. He also attended VP! \r\nfor post-gra<luate work. He began teaching at Clemson on September l, 1948, and has been \r\nhere ever since. \r\nOnce referred to by President Emeritus Robert Edwards as \"one of the truly great \r\nteachers in Clemson's first century of service to mankind,\" P.B. has served under seven of \r\nl 4 presi<lents and has won virtually every award the University bestows. He was the first \r\nrecipient of the Byars Awar<l for Teaching Excellence in Engineering Mechanics and the \r\nFrank F. Burtner Awar<l for A<lvising. He has been a member of the Order of Athena \r\nChapter of Mortar Boar<l National Honor Society, Tiger Brotherhood, Blue Key and Chi \r\nEpsilon. He's won the National Society of Professional Engineers Educator of the Year \r\nAward, Tau Beta Pi Eminent Engineer Award, Chi Epsilon Outstanding Teacher Award, \r\nRobert W . Moorman Award from Tiger Brotherhood, Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award \r\nand Master Teacher Award. In 1989 he was honore<l as an Alumni Distinguished Professor \r\nof Civil Engineering. \r\nAlthough highly decorate<l by official honors and awar<ls, P.B. is best known for his \r\nteaching style, his re lationship with students, his ability to befriend and father. He's been \r\nknown to spen<l five hours per <lay just talking with students in his office. He learns every \r\nstudent's name in his classes, so he builds a personal relationship with each one of them. \r\nThere are thousan<ls of students who are inspired by his wisdom and achieve beyond their \r\nhopes because of his encouragement. As one colleague sai<l, \"P.B. does more than educate \r\nstudents; he makes them better human beings.\" \r\nMaybe P.B.'s contributions are best summarized in the words of one of his students: \r\n\"What really sets you apart from other professors is your interest in each of your students as \r\nindividuals, not merely as students. Teachers who take this kind of approach to students are \r\nthe ones who truly make a <lifference in shaping our lives.\" \r\nBecause of his dedication an<l genuine concern for stu<lents as well as his unsurpassed \r\nloyalty and 50-year service to Clemson University, we are honored to present Professor \r\nRobert Francis Nowack with the honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty fo llow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academ ic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black ve lvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the award ing \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma ll est, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the C lemson \r\nUniversity hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron {a \"Y\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, C lemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with chat registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military \r\nregalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand carnelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green C lemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof sc ientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year \r\ncurricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the \r\nUniversity has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, \r\nForestry and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, \r\nthe College of Business and Public Affairs, the College of Engineering and \r\nScience, the College of Health, Education and Human Development, and the \r\nGraduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the Accreditation \r\nBoard for Engineering and Technology, American Assembly of Collegiate \r\nSchools of Business, American Council for Construction Education, American \r\nSociety of Landscape Architects, Computing Science Accreditation Board, \r\nHuman Factors and Ergonomics Society, International Association for \r\nManagement Education, National Architectural Accrediting Board, National \r\nAssociation of Industrial Technology, National Association of State Directors \r\nof Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of \r\nTeacher Education, National League for Nursing, Planning Accrediting Board, \r\nand Society of American Foresters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is \r\nalso heavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the \r\nwork of agricultura l extension which has professional personnel located in each \r\nof the State's counties.
