        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nDOCTOR OF LETTERS \r\nJACK C. MCCORMAC \r\nSouth Carolinian and Clemson Professor Emeritus Jack McCormac consistently \r\nhas been one of the most effective and highly regarded classroom teachers at the \r\nUniversity, but he has gained his greatest recognition as an author of textbooks. He \r\nhas published seven major texts and is considered to be among the leading authors \r\nof engineering texts in the world. \r\nProfessor McCormac was born in Columbia and earned undergraduate and \r\ngraduate degrees in civil engineering at The Citadel and at the Massachusetts \r\nInstitute of Technology. He joined the faculty at Clemson where he taught civil \r\nengineering for 36 years. He attained the level of full professor and was named to a \r\nprestigious alumni distinguished professorship, winning great praise from his \r\nstudents for his teaching style, enthusiasm and his ability to motivate them. \r\nProfessor McCormac has written and published several editions of texts on \r\nsubjects of structural analysis, structural steel design, reinforced concrete design and \r\nsurveying. His textbooks have been adopted at more than 500 colleges and \r\nuniversities around the world and have been translated into five languages. More \r\nthan 750,000 texts authored by him have been sold. In addition, he has written parts \r\nof several significant engineering handbooks. \r\nHis worldwide reputation as a distinguished civil engineer educator has helped \r\nClemson solidify its position as an outstanding undergraduate education institution. \r\nHis many honors and awards include an endowed alumni professorship, AT&T \r\naward from the American Society for Engineering Education, Educator of the Year \r\nfrom the Piedmont Chapter of the S.C. Society of Professional Engineers, a national \r\ncitation from the American Institute of Steel Construction, a chapter honor member of \r\nChi Epsilon (civil engineering honor society), Distinguished Practicing Engineering \r\nAward from Tau Beta Pi and Distinguished Alumnus of The Citadel. \r\nProfessor McCormac embodies those ideals that Clemson University values. \r\nHis wide recognition and respect as an author and educator place him in a unique \r\nposition to represent Clemson and its educational mission to audiences throughout \r\nthe world. \r\nIt is indeed a most significant occasion when Clemson University recognizes \r\nand honors one of its own with the presentation of an honorary doctorate for eminent \r\nachievement in scholarship and genuine service to the world academic community. \r\nWe all are extremely proud of the enormous impact he has made on civil engineering \r\neducation through his many textbooks as well as his teaching of several thousand \r\ncivil engineering students in his years at Clemson. \r\nWe hold Professor Emeritus Jack McCormac and his lifetime achievements in \r\nthe highest esteem, and it is a distinct privilege to honor him with the presentation of \r\nthe Doctor of Letters.

Moorman, Jr., whose family ties to Clemson are rooted in the \r\nearly days of the college itself, is vice chief of staff, Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, Washington, \r\nD.C. \r\nGeneral Moorman, who was promoted to general on August 1, 1994, has served in a variety \r\nof intelligence and reconnaissance-related positions within the United States and worldwide. \r\nWhile stationed at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, in 1982, he became deeply involved in \r\nplanning and organizing the establishment of Air Force Space Command. As commander and \r\nvice commander of Air Force Space Command, General Moorman was responsible for operating \r\nmilitary space systems, ground-based radars and missile warning satellites, the nation's space \r\nlaunch centers at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, the \r\nworldwide network of space surveillance radars, as well as maintaining the Intercontinental \r\nBallistic Missile force. \r\nGeneral Moorman was born in Washington, D.C., and received his undergraduate \r\neducation at Dartmouth College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and political \r\nscience and was commissioned through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps as a \r\ndistinguished military graduate in 1962. General Moorman also has a master's degree in \r\nbusiness administration from Western New England College (1972), and a master's degree in \r\npolitical science from Auburn University (1975). \r\nIn 1995 General Moorman received the prestigious Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy \r\nfor his contributions to the nation's space program. The recipient is chosen annually for great \r\nachievement in advancing space flight programs which contribute to U.S. leadership in \r\nastronautics. \r\nAlthough not a Clemson alumnus, General Moorman's ties to Clemson historically have \r\nbeen very strong, and his is one of Clemson's historic family names. His grandfather, Thomas S. \r\nMoorman, graduated as a member of Clemson's first class in 1896, became a career officer, and \r\nyears later returned to Clemson as colonel and professor of military science and tactics. He later \r\nheld the position of commandant. Since that time the Moorman family has continued a direct \r\nrelationship to Clemson. \r\nGeneral Moorman's father, also named Thomas, is now a retired Air Force lieutenant \r\ngeneral living in Colorado Springs where he served his last assignment as superintendent of the \r\nAir Force Academy. The honoree's uncle, Robert Moorman, graduated from Clemson and served \r\nas a faculty member, was head of the engineering mechanics department, and coached the \r\nUniversity golf team. \r\nAn aunt, Betty Moorman, worked in the University's business and finance office for 34 years \r\nand is now retired and lives in Clemson. Another aunt, the late Marie Moorman Grimes, was a \r\nsecretary to Dean Sams of the former School of Engineering. The Moorman tradition at Clemson \r\ncontinued as the general's son, John Moorman, graduated from Clemson in 1992. \r\nWe hold General Thomas Moorman and his lifetime achievements in the highest esteem, \r\nand it is a distinct privilege to honor him for his untold contributions to our nation's defense and \r\nto the unparalleled success of the U.S. space program. We present him the honorary degree of \r\nDoctor of Laws. "

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and \r\nhonored guests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is \r\npreceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, described \r\nunder University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a \r\ncombination of colors that declare the disciplines taught in that college . These \r\ncolors, which were established by the American Council on Education, are as \r\nfollows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing \r\nacademic costumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from \r\ninstitutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding \r\ninstitutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' \r\ninstitutions are specified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council \r\non Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of \r\nPhilosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or \r\ndiscipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' \r\ngowns, also black, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that \r\nterminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. \r\nDoctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels \r\nand the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with \r\nblack velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline \r\ncolor. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the \r\nawarding institution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with \r\nbachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different \r\nshape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also \r\nconveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging \r\nthe hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, \r\nwhich designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the \r\nhood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are displayed in \r\ncombinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University \r\nhood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a ''V\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently \r\nthe only institution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or \r\nmilitary regalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the \r\nUniversity Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal \r\nwears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty \r\ndo not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and \r\nguests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of \r\nClemson University and must be present at any convocation where the \r\nUniversity, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any \r\nofficial convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, \r\ncarrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace \r\nrests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the \r\nceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, \r\nthus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the \r\nceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle \r\nAges. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably \r\ngoing back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, \r\nwith the seal of the University in gold and the University colors \r\nrepresented by insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). \r\nAmethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in \r\nthe office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for \r\nthe whole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of \r\nsilver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \r\n\"staffs of office\" which were carried by the senior members of \r\ndepartments of state or church. They display the seal of the University \r\nand the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. \r\nClemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert \r\nEbendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of \r\nthe most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the \r\nbatons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the \r\nlapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson \r\nUniversity. "

        "text": "Coat of Arms \r\nDesigned by Clemson University graphic artist, Connie Floyd, the \r\ncoat of arms represents the historic three-fold mission of this \r\ninstitution: teaching, research and service. \r\nPictured on the cover, the coat of arms is divided into three parts. The \r\nbottom contains a series of open books representing the concept of \r\nteaching as the basis of the land-grant university. The white of the books \r\nand the purple of the background designate the teaching mission of the \r\nUniversity as it is achieved through undergraduate and graduate \r\ninstruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and \r\nwheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, as \r\nwell as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The three \r\nsymbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also represent the \r\nhumanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield bearing a \r\nwhite tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of Clemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas Green \r\nClemson's desire that Clemson become \"the people's university\" for \r\nSouth Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, orange, white and \r\ngold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, are the official colors of \r\nthe University; the inner pair, orange and white, are Clemson's student \r\ncolors. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-\r\n1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the \r\nfounding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at \r\nthe Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was \r\nthat of a mining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his \r\ninterests into politics and the life of a southern planter, and he soon \r\nbecame an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a \r\ncareer as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and \r\nserved as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in \r\nWashington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the \r\nfields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities \r\nincluded his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural \r\nCollege, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina \r\nafter the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. \r\nCalhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half \r\nof the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved \r\non the Clemson Campus as a national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446.
