        "text": "HISTORICAL STATEMENT \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who left the \r\nbulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a \r\nsouthern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. \r\nHe had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as \r\nthe first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he \r\npublished numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His \r\nvaried activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural \r\nCollege, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil \r\nWar, and his part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. \r\nMr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a national \r\nshrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of \r\n446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major \r\nacademic units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, the College of Business and Behavioral \r\nScience, the College of Engineering and Science, the College of Health, Education, and \r\nHuman Development, and the Graduate School. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \r\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-\r\n4097; telephone number 404-679-4501) to award the Bachelor's, Master's, Education \r\nSpecialist, and Doctor's degrees. Various curricula are accredited by the AACSB \r\nInternational (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation \r\nBoard for Engineering and Technology, American Council for Construction Education, \r\nAmerican Dietetic Association, American Society of Landscape Architects, Computing \r\nScience Accreditation Board, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related \r\nEducation Programs (CACREP), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National \r\nAssociation of Schools of Art and Design, National Council for Accreditation of \r\nTeacher Education, National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, \r\nNRPA/AALR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of \r\nAmerican Foresters. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary \r\nacademic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five \r\nagricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also heavily \r\ncommitted to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural \r\nextension which has professional personnel located in each of the State's counties.

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nPHYLLIS S BUCHANAN \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nPhyllis S Buchanan has not only demonstrated her personal devotion to educational quality and \r\ninnovation for students of all ages; she has recruited others to take up the cause as well. She \r\ncontinues to inspire her collaborators in this important effort. \r\nBuchanan earned both her Bachelor of Science and Master of Education degrees from Widener \r\nUniversity. Her current position as manager of the DuPont Office of Education is backed by 34 \r\nyears with the company and more than 25 years of experience with its Corporate Education \r\nProgram. \r\nShe has overseen corporate support for science education and leading-edge research at the \r\nuniversity level, identified and contributed to the development of national programs that \r\npromote young people's interest in science and technology, and repositioned significant \r\nresources to support K-12 science and mathematics education reform. \r\nAs manager of this ambitious agenda, she weaves together an extensive network of alliances and \r\npartners across all educational levels and engages DuPont as a catalyst for reform and \r\nimprovement. Her dream is to educate students today for a more knowledgeable work force for \r\ntomorrow. \r\nFor that reason, Buchanan has become an ambassador for science learning. She is committed to \r\ntransforming the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines from textbook\u0002based education to engaged and active learning. From innovation to experimentation to \r\nimplementation, she helped coordinate a state-level transition to a hands-on, inquiry-centered \r\nprogram in Delaware. This program has helped close the achievement gap in Delaware and will \r\nserve as a model for other states. \r\nBuchanan's leadership fuels movements to empower young people from all backgrounds, and \r\nthat leadership has helped produce another highly successful program here at Clemson. The \r\nCall Me MISTER\u00ae program has garnered national attention, and Buchanan was a key member \r\nin its development. The program is aimed at finding and promoting African American males to \r\nbe elementary school teachers in South Carolina. It, too, is being considered as a model for \r\nsimilar programs in other states, and Buchanan's involvement is testament to her role as a \r\nground breaker. \r\nBuchanan is a member of several boards, including the Triangle Coalition for Science and \r\nTechnology Education Board of Directors, the FIRST Philadelphia Regional Advisory Board \r\n(Drexel University), the National Science Resources Center's National LASER Advisory Board \r\nand the Science Olympiad National Advisory Board. \r\nShe also works collaboratively with teachers and educators in a number of states, South \r\nCarolina among them, and actively encourages all DuPont employees to contribute expertise \r\nand resources to improve science and mathematics education. \r\nBuchanan's dedication to the welfare of students is not limited to the office or boardroom; she \r\nmentors more than 20 students in the Pioneer Student Leadership Academy. Co-founder of this \r\nacademy, she works one-on-one with students to ensure that they are prepared for the 21\" \r\ncentury work force. \r\nClemson University is honored to acknowledge the eminent achievements of this champion for \r\neducation. It is a distinct privilege to present Phyllis S Buchanan with the honorary degree, \r\nDoctor of Humanities. "

        "text": "THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored guests of the \r\nUniversity. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by irs marshal, a senior faculty member, with \r\nthe college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that declare the \r\ndisciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on \r\nEducation, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestty, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nFores tty \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArch itecrure \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInsttuction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval \r\norigin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes \r\nspecified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified by a \r\nuniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar \r\nboards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black \r\nor discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer \r\nthan bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since 1960 have sleeves \r\nextended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and \r\nthe sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to \r\nreplace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, \r\ndegree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and doctors' quite large \r\nand of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also \r\nconveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the \r\nthroat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy \r\n(Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors are \r\ndisplayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson University hood is lined \r\nwith purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although many combinations are duplicated by \r\ndozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set forth by \r\ntheir professions with the President of Clemson University wearing a purple gown with four velvet bars piped \r\nin gold and the University seal embroidered on the panels. The Trustees wear a similar gown with three \r\nvelvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not \r\nhold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from the awarding school. They are preceded by the \r\nUniversity Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the \r\nUniversity mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but are dismissed, \r\nalong with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its \r\ndelegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as \r\ncommencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the President into \r\nthe assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout \r\nthe ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic \r\nof the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried \r\nby heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic clublike shape, however, is \r\nmuch more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood \r\nand silver, with the seal of the University in gold and the University colors represented \r\nby insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of \r\nSouth Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of \r\npresident by the governing body of the University. Only the University President may \r\nwear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's \r\nchain and seal are made of silver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of office\" which \r\nwere carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the \r\nseal of the University and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college \r\nbelongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. \r\nEbendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths \r\nof our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late Professor \r\nMarshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of \r\nClemson University. "
