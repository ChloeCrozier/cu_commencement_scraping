HoNORARY DEGREE 
Lindsey Olin Graham 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Elected U.S. Senator from South Carolina on Nov. 5, 2002, Senator 
Lindsey Graham embarked on his life's work of serving and protecting 
the public good two decades earlier. 
A native of nearby Central and a graduate of the University of South 
Carolina (BA 1977, JD 1981), Senator Graham devoted six and a half 
years to active duty service as an attorney in the U.S. Air Force. From 
1984 to 1988, he served overseas at the Rhein Mein Air Force Base in 
Germany. Upon leaving active duty in 1989, he joined the S.C. Air 
National Guard where he served until his election to the U.S. House 
of Representatives in 1994. 
During the Gulf War, he was called to active duty and served stateside as Staff Judge Advocate 
at McEntire Air National Guard Base preparing troops for deployment, for which he earned a 
commendation medal. Since 1995, he has served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and is one of only 
three U.S. senators currently serving in the Guard or Reserves. He holds the rank of colonel and is 
assigned as a senior instructor at the Air Force JAG School. 
In 1988, Senator Graham went into private law practice and was elected to the S.C. House of 
Representatives in 1992. In 1994, he became the first Republican to represent South Carolina's 
Third Congressional District in Washington, D.C., since 1877. 
Senator Graham's devoted service as senior senator from South Carolina and his leadership on 
five vital U.S. Senate committees-Appropriations, Armed Services, Aging, Budget and Judiciary-are 
critically important for the citizens of our state and our nation. Further, he has consistently shown 
extraordinary character and leadership by building broad-based coalitions to allow our government 
to function effectively and avoid costly partisan stalemates. 
He is known as a leader who fights to balance the federal budget, provide tax relief to all taxpayers, 
keep our military adequately funded and prepared, return control of education to parents and 
teachers, and ensure the government keeps it promises to America's greatest generation. 
Senator Graham is a strong national advocate for Clemson University's economic development 
initiatives, particularly those related to leading our state and our nation to energy independence 
and a green economy. At a Clemson-hosted summit on renewable energy in 2009, he said, "What 
Clemson has been able to achieve in this area of ... the new economy for the United States is incredibly 
impressive." He also partners with the University through programs of the Strom Thurmond Institute, 
bringing attention to pressing national and international issues. 
Over the course of his distinguished public service career, Senator Graham has received numerous 
honors and awards, including honorary doctorates from the University of South Carolina, the 
Medical University of South Carolina and 10 other South Carolina institutions. 
Clemson University holds Senator Graham's remarkable life of service to his country and to the 
people of South Carolina in the highest regard. In recognition of his eminent achievements and 
contributions, it is a great privilege to present the honorary degree, Doctorate of Humanities, to 
Senator Lindsey Olin Graham.

THE AcADEMIC PRoCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole 
of Clemson University and must be present at any convocation 
where the University, through its delegated members, is acting 
officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, 
the university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president 
into the assembly. The mace rests before the president's chair 
or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal 
from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of 
the official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of 
the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the 
ceremonial maces carried by heads of the state and church in the 
Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, is much more 
ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of 
walnut wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the 
university colors represented by insets of carnelian (orange) 
and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South 
Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority 
vested in the office of president by the governing body of the 
University. Only the university president may wear it, and while 
wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. 
Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and 
carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval 
"staffs of office," which were carried by the senior members of 
departments of state or church. They display the university seal 
and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college 
belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver 
with the various disciplines inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed 
by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the 
Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed goldsmiths of our 
era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by 
the late Mr. C C Wilson of C lemson University. 
HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson 
( 1807 -1888), who left the bulk of his estate to the state of South 
Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and 
educated at the Royal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). 
His early profession was that of a mining engineer; however, 
circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life 
of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic 
advocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat 
(charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first 
superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). 
As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of 
mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included 
his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South 
Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson 
University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a 
South Carolina political figure of national importance during 
the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, 
Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national 
shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with 
an enrollment of 446. The first "college prospectus" announced 
only two four-year curricula, supplemented by two two-year 
preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life 
Sciences; the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities; 
the College of Business and Behavioral Science; the College of 
Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and 
Human Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges 
of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the 
bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. 
Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, 
Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions 
about the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by MCSB International (Association to 
Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology, American Council for Construction 
Education, American Dietetic Association (CADE), American 
SocietyofLandscapeArchitects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing 
Education (CCNE), Council for Accreditation of Counseling and 
Related Education Programs (CACREP), National Architectural 
Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and 
Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 
NRPN MLR Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation 
Board, and Society of American Foresters. Documentation 
of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not 
only in its primary academic program, but does extensive research 
at the main campus and at five agricultural experiment stations 
located in the state. The University is also heavily committed 
to a varied program of public service, including the work of 
agricultural extension, which has professional personnel located 
in each of the state's counties.
