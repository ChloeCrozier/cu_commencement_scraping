HoNORARY DEGREE 
Anita Goldberg Zucker 
Doctorate of Humanities 
Anita Zucker is an accomplished woman. She is well-known for her involvement in 
successful businesses, philanthropy and leadership positions that range from local issues 
to global influences. Yet, for anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting Anita, it is her 
generosity of self, her sincerity, positive attitude and what we at Clemson University call 
"Determined Spirit" that leave a lasting impression. 
A longtime advocate for education and a renowned South Carolina philanthropist, 
Anita, her late husband, Jerry, and their three children have devoted their lives to the 
principles ofTikkun Olam, a Hebrew term that means "world repair." She continues to 
set an example and show the way through faith, family and community. 
Anita's inventive, adventurous and curious nature was nurtured by her parents, both Holocaust victims, 
and later encouraged by her husband as they worked together to build numerous businesses. Anita has 
faithfully served to assist, encourage, support and inspire through her relationships with her children, her 
many students, associates and friends. 
A graduate of the University of Florida, where she received her bachelor's degree in education, Anita went 
on to earn a master's degree in educational administration and supervision from the University of North 
Florida. She taught elementary school in Florida and South Carolina for more than a decade. 
Today, Anita is chairperson and CEO of The Inter Tech Group, Inc. She is also the owner of the Carolina 
lee Palace, the South Carolina Stingrays and Tristan restaurant in Charleston. 
She has served in countless philanthropic organizations. She was chairperson of the Board of Governors 
of the School of Business at the College of Charleston and on the board of the Addlestone Hebrew Academy, 
Porter Gaud and Ashley Hall schools. Anita is past chair of the MUSC Foundation Board, and member 
emeritus of Hollings Cancer Center Citizens Advisory Committee. Currently, she serves on the President's 
Initiative Committee at the University of South Carolina. 
Clemson University has a good friend in Anita Zucker. Although not an alumna, she likes what she sees 
happening in the University, especially in regard to CURl, the Clemson University Restoration Institute in 
North Charleston. Her family's gift for the Graduate Education Center at CURl will soon be serving to foster 
and nurture the inventive, adventurous and curious nature of countless students and faculty. Anita believes in 
supporting causes that assure positive outcomes. Her generous gift to Clemson will assure positive outcomes, 
both educationally and economically. 
Clemson University recognizes Anita Zucker's achievements and pays tribute to her valuable friendship 
with our University. It is a great privilege to present today the honorary degree, Doctorate of Humanities, to 
Anita Goldberg Zucker.

THE ACADEMIC PROCESSION 
The academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees and most honored guests of the University. 
Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a senior faculty member, with the college baton, 
described under University Regalia. The college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors 
that declare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American Council on 
Education, are listed below. 
Collegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of medieval origin. Those 
who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States wear costumes specified by the awarding 
institutions. Academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from institutions in the United States are specified by a 
uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually mortar boards with 
tassels. Doctors of philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. 
The bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, are longer than bachelors' 
gowns. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow, while those since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. 
Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three 
velvet bars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the 
discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. 
All hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. First, degree level is 
signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' the smallest, masters' larger and doctors' quite large and of a different 
shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the 
degree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is 
dark blue, which designates the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the 
awarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson 
University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a "V"). Although many combinations are 
duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only institution with that registered combination. 
The officers, trustees and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical or military regalia as set forth by their professions. 
The president of Clemson University wears a purple gown with four velvet bars piped in gold and the university seal 
embroidered on the panels. Each trustee wears a similar gown with three velvet bars piped in gold for doctorates and an 
embroidered palmetto tree on each sleeve for those who do not hold doctorates. Hoods are either from Clemson or from 
the awarding school. They are preceded by the university marshal. Clad in a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal 
wears no hood and bears the university mace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional 
but are dismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum.

THE UNIVERSITY REGALIA 
The university mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson University 
and must be present at any convocation where the University, through its delegated 
members, is acting officially. At any official convocation such as commencement, the 
university marshal, carrying the mace, precedes the president into the assembly. The 
mace rests before the president's chair or speaker's stand throughout the ceremony, 
and its removal from the assembly at the close of a convocation is symbolic of the 
official withdrawal of the University and, thus, the close of the proceedings. 
The decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial maces carried 
by heads of the state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic club-like shape, however, 
is much more ancient, probably going back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut 
wood and silver, with Clemson's seal in gold and the university colors represented by 
insets of carnelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of 
South Carolina. 
The presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the office of 
president by the governing body of the University. Only the university president may 
wear it, and while wearing it, he speaks for the whole body of the institution. Clemson's 
chain and seal are made of silver and gold, and carnelian and amethyst. 
The batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval "staffs of office," which 
were carried by the senior members of departments of state or church. They display the 
university seal and the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. 
Clemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various disciplines 
inset with enamel. 
The Clemson University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. 
Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most acclaimed 
goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were executed by the late 
Professor Marshall C Bell, and the lapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C C 
Wilson of Clemson University.

HISTORICAL STATEMENT 
Clemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807 -1888), who left the 
bulk of his estate to the state of South Carolina for the founding of the institution. 
Thomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal School 
of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining engineer; 
however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life of a southern 
planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific agriculture. He 
had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852) and served as 
the first superintendent of agricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he 
published numerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His 
varied activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural 
College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil 
War, and his part in founding Clemson University. 
Thomas Clemson was the son-in-law of John C Calhoun, a South Carolina political 
figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mr. 
Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson campus as a national shrine. 
The academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment of 446. 
The first "college prospectus" announced only two four-year curricula, supplemented 
by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has six major academic 
units. These are the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences; the College of 
Architecture, Arts and Humanities; the College of Business and Behavioral Science; 
the College of Engineering and Science; the College of Health, Education and Human 
Development; and the Graduate School. 
Clemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the bachelor's, master's, education 
specialist, and doctoral degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 
Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call at 404-679-4500 for questions about 
the accreditation of Clemson University. 
Curricula are accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate 
Schools of Business), Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, American 
Council for Construction Education, American Dietetic Association ( CADE), American 
SocietyofLandscapeArchitects, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), 
Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), 
National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Association of Schools of Art and 
Design, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, NRPN AALR 
Council on Accreditation, Planning Accreditation Board, and Society of American 
Foresters. Documentation of accreditation is available in the college deans' offices. 
Clemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its primary 
academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and at five 
agricultural experiment stations located in the state. The University is also heavily 
committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural 
extension, which has professional personnel located in each of the state's counties.

Dear old Clemson, we will triumph 
And with all our might, 
That the Tiger's roar may echo 
0' er the mountain height. 
We will dream of greater conquests, 
For our past is grand, 
And her sons have fought and conquered 
Every foreign land. 
Where the mountains smile in grandeur 
0' er the hill and dale. 
Here the Tiger lair is nestling 
Swept by storm and gale. 
We are brothers strong in manhood, 
For we work and strive; 
And our alma mater reigneth 
Ever in our lives.
