        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines caught in that college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arts, and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Behavioral Science \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealch, Education, and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nStaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArts \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United States wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. . \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; other degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while \r\nthose since 1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell,like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods to bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood to form the throat over the gown. \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, che color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice that the Clemson \r\nUniversity hooJ is line<l with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military \r\nregalia as set forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. At the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a part of the recessional but arc \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the Presidenr>s chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of cornelian {orange) \r\nand amethyst {purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South C~rolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson\u2022s chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice,, which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "/ \r\nHistorical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson ( 1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington ( 1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son,in,law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nine.teenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as \r\na national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an \r\nenrollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four,year \r\ncurricula, supplemented by two two,year preparatory courses. Today the \r\nUniversity has six major academic units. These are the College of Agriculture, \r\nForestry, and Life Sciences, the College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities, \r\nthe College of Business and Behavioral Science, the College of Engineering \r\nand Science, the College of Health, Education, and Human Development, and \r\nthe Graduate School. \r\nClemson University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the \r\nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, \r\nGeorgia 30033,4097; telephone number 404,679,4501) to award the Bachelor's, \r\nMaster's, Education Specialist, and Doctor's degrees.
