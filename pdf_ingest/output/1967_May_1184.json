        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), \r\nwho left the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the \r\nfounding of the institution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that \r\nof a mining engineer; but circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a Southern Planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic \r\nadvocate of scientific agriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge \r\nd'affaires to Belgium, 1844-1852), and served as the first superintendent of \r\nagricultural affairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published \r\nnumerous articles in the fields of mining, chemistry, and agriculture. His \r\nvaried activities included his assistance in the founding of the Maryland \r\nAgricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his leadership in South \r\nCarolina after the Civil War, and his part in the founding of Clemson \r\nUniversity. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. \r\nCalhoun, a political figure of national importance during the first half of \r\nthe nineteenth century. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on \r\nthe Clemson campus as a national shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an en\u0002rollment of 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four\u0002year curricula, supplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today \r\nClemson University's enrollment is 5,800 and the current catalog lists \r\nthirty-eight undergraduate and fifty-six graduate curricula. \r\nThe University has seven major academic units. These are the College \r\nof Agriculture and Biological Sciences; the School of Architecture; the \r\nCollege of Arts and Sciences; the School of Education; the College of \r\nEngineering; the School of Industrial Management and Textile Science; \r\nand the School of Graduate Study. \r\nThe institution became an accredited member of the Southern Associa\u0002tion of Colleges and Schools in 1927. The civil, electrical, and mechanical \r\nengineering curricula were accredited by the Engineers' Council for Pro\u0002fessional Development in 1937. Curricula in agricultural, ceramic, and \r\nchemical engineering were accredited by ECPD in 1953, 1955, and 1959, \r\nrespectively. \r\nThe chemistry curriculum was first accredited by the American Chemi\u0002cal Society in 1953 and the architectural curriculum by the National Archi\u0002tectural Accrediting Board in 1956. The forestry curriculum was accredited \r\nby the Society of American Foresters in 1962. \r\nClemson is the Land-Grant University of South Carolina. As such the \r\ninstitution is engaged not only in its primary academic program, but does \r\nextensive research at the main campus and at six agricultural experiment \r\nstations located in the state. The University is also heavily committed to \r\na varied program of public service, including the work of agricultural ex\u0002tension which has professional personnel located in each of the state's \r\ncounties.
