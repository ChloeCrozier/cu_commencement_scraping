The \r\ncontributions she made to students, colleagues and the future of Clemson are immeas urable \r\nand resonate in the lives she personally touched and in those who never knew her but feel \r\nher impact today. \r\nDean Delony received her bachelor's degree in 1945 from Auburn University and her \r\nmaster's from Cornell University in 1951. She followed her formal education with summer \r\nstudies at Michigan State and the Teachers College of Columbia University. \r\nHer first appointment in Academe was as an instructor at the Woman's College of North \r\nCarolina, followed by assistant professorships at Montana State College and Auburn \r\nUniversity. Dean Delony became the assistant dean of women at Auburn in 1957 and \r\nremained there until l 963 when she was hired as the first dean of women at C lemson. For 14 \r\nyears, she served in this post and was late r promoted to assoc iate dean of students. \r\nWhen Dean Delony joined C lemson's ranks, there was a great need for programs, \r\nopportunities and facilities for women. (They had been admitted to C lemson on ly years \r\nbefore, in 1955.) Dean Delony met this cha llenge with resolve and passion. During her \r\ntenure, she was instrumental in the formation and development of the Residence H a 11 \r\nProgram for women and the Resident Assistant Program. In 1969, she brought national \r\nwomen's social fraternities to C lemson, establish ing the foundation fo r the successful Greek \r\nLife the University enjoys today. She helped found Alpha Lamba Delta freshman honor \r\nsociety as well as Mortar Board. President Emeritus Walter Cox has ca lled hiring Dean \r\nDelany \"one of the best recommendations 1 made in my tenure at C lemson.\" \r\nIn add ition co her ach ievements at the University, Dean Delany has provided \r\noutstanding se rvice to her community. While enjoying retirement in her birthplace of \r\nTuscumbia , Alabama, she retains active membership in her church and has served on a \r\nfeasibility study for the Consolidation Committee of Tuscumbia. She is past president of the \r\nMaud Lindsay Study Club, volunteer of the Tennessee Valley Art Association Guild and \r\nhas served and is currently on the Board of Friends of the Helen Keller Public Library. \r\nDean Delony has made it her life's work to establish a high standard of character and \r\nvision for all with whom she has contact. Her sp irit pervades the campus each and every day \r\nthe University thrives. le is with gre at honor and pleasure chat we recognize chis individual \r\nwho truly made a difference in the lives of students and of chis University during a critica l \r\ntime in its history. We hereby present Susan Goodwin Delony with the honorary Doctor of \r\nHumanities degree. "

For over SO years, he has served C lemson University in numerous \r\ncapacities-from the Clemson Little Theatre to the Social Committee of Clemson \r\nCollege to being a charter member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He has contributed not only \r\nto Clemson University, but to tens of thousands of students who now define the cultural, \r\nsocia l and educational fabric of America. \r\nProfessor Bob Nowack, or P.B. as he is better known, received his bachelor's degree from \r\nCarnegie Mellon and a master's from the University of Pittsburgh. He also attended VP! \r\nfor post-graduate work. He began teaching at Clemson on September 1, 1948, and has been \r\nhere ever since. \r\nOnce referred to by President Emeritus Robert Edwards as \"one of the truly great \r\nteachers in Clemson's first century of service to mankind,\" P.B. has served under seven of \r\nl 4 presidents and has won virtually every award the University bestows. He was the first \r\nrecipient of the Byars Award for Teaching Excellence in Engineering Mechanics and the \r\nFrank F. Burtner Award for Advising. He has been a member of the Order of Athena \r\nChapter of Mortar Board National Honor Society, Tiger Brotherhood, Blue Key and Chi \r\nEpsilon. He's won the National Society of Professional Engineers Educator of the Year \r\nAward, Tau Beta Pi Eminent Engineer Award, Chi Epsilon Outstanding Teacher Award, \r\nRobert W. Moorman Award from Tiger Brotherhood, Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award \r\nand Master Teacher Award . In 1989 he was honored as an Alumni Distinguished Professor \r\nof Civil Engineering. \r\nAlthough highly decorated by official honors and awards, P.B. is best known for his \r\nteaching style, his relationship with students, his ability to befriend and father. He's been \r\nknown to spend five hours per day just talking with students in his office. He learns every \r\nstudent's name in his classes, so he builds a personal relationship with each one of them. \r\nThere are thousands of students who are inspired by his wisdom and achieve beyond their \r\nhopes because of his encouragement. As one colleague said, \"P.B. does more than educate \r\nstudents; he makes them better human beings.\" \r\nMaybe P.B.'s contributions are best summarized in the words of one of his students: \r\n\"What really sets you apart from other professors is your interest in each of your students as \r\nindividuals, not merely as students. Teachers who take chis kind of approach to students are \r\nthe ones who truly make a difference in shaping our lives.\" \r\nBecause of his dedication and genuine concern for students as well as his unsurpassed \r\nloyalty and SO-year service to Clemson University, we are honored to present Professor \r\nRobert Francis Nowack with the honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, \r\na senior faculty member, with the college bacon, described under University Regalia. \r\nThe college banners are placed on the stage. Each banner is a combination of colors chat \r\ndeclare the disciplines caught in chat college. These colors, which were established by the \r\nAmerican Council on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege \r\nAgriculture, Forestry and Life \r\nSciences \r\nArchitecture, Arcs and \r\nHumanities \r\nBusiness and Public Affairs \r\nEngineering and Science \r\nHealth, Education and Human \r\nDevelopment \r\nLibrary \r\nScaff \r\nFaculty Senate \r\nColors \r\nMaize \r\nBrown \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLilac \r\nBrown \r\nWhite \r\nDark Blue \r\nDrab \r\nCopper \r\nPeacock Blue \r\nCream \r\nOrange \r\nGolden Yellow \r\nLight Blue \r\nApricot \r\nCream \r\nLemon Yellow \r\nPurple and Orange \r\nPurple and White \r\nDiscipline \r\nAgriculture \r\nForestry \r\nLife Sciences \r\nArchitecture \r\nArcs \r\nHumanities \r\nPhilosophy \r\nAccounting and Business \r\nEconomics \r\nPublic Administration \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nEngineering \r\nScience \r\nEducation \r\nNursing \r\nSocial Sciences \r\nLibrary \r\nAcademic Support \r\nInstruction \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their marshal in order of academic rank wearing academic \r\ncostumes of medieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside \r\nthe United Scates wear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions a re \r\nspecified by a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are \r\nblack and are usually mortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels \r\nusually of metallic thread; ocher degrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also \r\nblack, are longer than bachelors. O lder gowns have sleeves chat terminate at the elbow while \r\nchose since 1960 have sleeves extended co the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like \r\nsleeves. The front is marked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet \r\nbars. While most gowns are black with black velvet, one variation is co replace black ve lvet \r\nwith velvet in the discipline color. A second variation is a colored gown usually of the \r\nuniversity's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding \r\ninstitution. First, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' sma ll est, \r\nmasters' larger, and doctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award \r\nhoods co bachelors. The width of the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the \r\ndegree is indicated by the color of the trim edging the hood co form the throat over the gown. \r\nThe most frequently seen is dark blue, which designates the doctor of phi losophy (Ph.D.) \r\ndegree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the awarding institution. The colors \r\nare displayed in combinations chat are drawn from heraldry. Notice chat the Clemson \r\nUniversity hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). Although \r\nmany combinations are duplicated by dozens of institutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastica l, or military \r\nregalia as sec forth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad \r\nin a gown of office in gold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University \r\nmace. Ac the ceremony's close, the faculty do not exit as a pare of the recessional but are \r\ndismissed, along with students and guests, when the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "1 \r\nI \r\n' I \r\nI \r\n' \r\nThe University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of Clemson \r\nUniversity and must be present at any convocation where the University, \r\nthrough its delegated members, is acting officially. At any official convocation \r\nsuch as commencement, the University Marshal, carrying the mace, precedes \r\nthe President into the assembly. The mace rests before the President's chair or \r\nspeaker's stand throughout the ceremony, and its removal from the assembly at \r\nthe close of a convocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the \r\nUniversity and, thus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the ceremonial \r\nmaces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle Ages. Its basic \r\nclublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably going back to man's \r\nprehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, with the seal of the University \r\nin gold and the University colors represented by insets of comelian (orange) \r\nand amethyst (purple). Amethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in the \r\noffice of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the whole \r\nbody of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of silver and gold, \r\nand comelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \"staffs of \r\noffice\" which were carried by the senior members of departments of state or \r\nchurch. They display the seal of the University and the symbolic color of the \r\ndiscipline to which the college belongs. Clemson's batons are made of walnut \r\nwood and silver with the various disciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert Ebendorf. \r\nMr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of the most \r\nacclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the batons were \r\nexecuted by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the lapidary work was \r\nexecuted by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson University. "

        "text": "Historical Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the \r\nRoyal School of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a \r\nmining engineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics \r\nand the life of a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate \r\nof scientific agricu lture. He had a career as a diplomat ( charge d'affaires to \r\nBelgium, 1844-1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural \r\nAffairs in Washington (1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in \r\nthe fields of mining, chemistry and agricu lture. His varied activities included \r\nhis assistance in the founding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support \r\nof the Morrill Act, his leadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and \r\nhis part in founding Clemson University. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury.
