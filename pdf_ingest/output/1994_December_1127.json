        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nCARROLL A. CAMPBELL, JR. \r\nDOCTOR OF LAWS \r\nThe Honorable Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., who has been called the maker of modern \r\ngovernorship in South Carolina, is the 112th person to occupy the Office of Governor \r\nof South Carolina. \r\nGovernor Campbell is only the second Republican in more than a century to attain \r\nthe state's highest office. He is the immediate past chairman of the National Governors \r\nAssociation, and the 1994 Almanac of American Politics calls him \" an exemplar of \r\ngoverning conservatism for the nation.\" \r\nGovernor Campbell has defined the modern governorship in South Carolina and \r\nhas positioned future governors to be major leaders in the development of public \r\npolicy for the state as well as leading the state on the national scene. He is one of the \r\nfew South Carolina governors to achieve a significant national reputation. \r\nBecause of his leadership in restructuring state government, the Office of Governor \r\nis a much stronger institution. Capping his three-year effort to reform state government, \r\nGovernor Campbell last year signed into law a sweeping overhaul plan that stream\u0002lined 79 agencies into 17, creating major new efficiencies and accountability measures. \r\nThe governor is recognized at home and across the nation as a leader in educa\u0002tion reform. He was a driving force behind the Cutting Edge, a major package of higher \r\neducation initiatives, and Target 2000, which is known for its revolutionary measures \r\nthat grant de-regulation and flexibility to our best-performing schools. \r\nMr. Campbell's emphasis on literacy and the challenges of the global economy \r\nprompted him to develop the Governor's Initiative on Work Force Excellence, which \r\nhas provided basic skills and literacy training at the work place to thousands of South \r\nCarolinians. \r\nUsing his home state and personal experience on these issues, Governor Camp\u0002bell championed the cause of \" lifelong learning\" as co-chair of the National Gover\u0002nors Association Task Force on Education and co-chair of the governors' historic edu\u0002cation summit with the president. In this role he was co-author - along with then\u0002Governor Bill Clinton - of the six ambitious goals that arose from that meeting with \r\nPresident Bush. \r\nThe governor's national leadership did not end when the goals were drafted \r\nand approved. He is former chairman of the National Education Goals Panel and past \r\nco-chairman of the National Council on Education Standards and Testing. \r\nHis person-to-person style as a salesman for South Carolina, traveling from the \r\nPacific Rim nations to the European Commonwealth, has helped produce an unprece\u0002dented $22 billion in capital investments for the state over the last seven and a half \r\nyears and more than 230,000 new jobs. The American Economic Development Council \r\nhonored him with its 1994 Excellence in Economic Development award for his hard \r\nwork and successful innovations. \r\nIn June 1992 Governor Campbell completed three years of intense, frequently \r\nsecretive negotiations with the German carmaker BMW, resulting in the company's \r\ndecision to build its first manufacturing plant outside Bavaria in Greer. It was the \r\nsingle largest economic development project announced in the United States that year. \r\nClemson University salutes Governor Campbell for a distinguished career of public \r\nservice to his state and nation. It is a distinct privilege for Clemson University to award \r\nthe honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, to Governor Carroll Campbell. "

Not a fierce partisan, he is known as one who tries to put the public \r\ninterest above partisanship. \r\nHis political career was launched in 1965 with his election to the South Carolina \r\nHouse of Representatives. Two years later, he was elected to the state Senate and \r\nhas served continuously since then. \r\nAs a businessman in his native Greenwood, he owns and operates a BP oil distri\u0002butorship, serving as president of BP Oil Company and president of Greenwood Petro\u0002leum Company. \r\nDuring World War II, Captain Drummond served as a fighter pilot with the 405th \r\nfighter bomber group in England, France and Germany.

In recognition of this and all he has meant to the \r\ncitizens of South Carolina, Clemson University presents the honorary degree, Doctor \r\nof Laws, to Senator John Drummond. "

        "text": "HONORARY DEGREE \r\nJOSEPH A. SHIRLEY \r\nDOCTOR OF HUMANITIES \r\nClemson alumnus and benefactor Joseph A. Shirley is a Clemson man in the \r\ntruest sense of the word. \r\nBorn in rural Greenwood County, he arrived at Clemson as a student with a \r\nstrong desire for an education. Mr. Shirley worked his way through four years of \r\ncollege, graduating in 1940 with a Bachelor of Science degree in textile chemistry. \r\nHe used his Clemson experience to enjoy professional and financial success. \r\nKnown as Col. Shirley to his many friends in the Clemson family, he served his \r\ncountry for 30 years in the Army. During World War II he parachuted into Normandy \r\nand the Netherlands as an airborne infantry commander. He later served as a nuclear \r\nweapons officer. \r\nIn a quiet and unassuming way, Col. Shirley has become one of the largest \r\nbenefactors in Clemson's history. In 1981 he began making significant donations to \r\nthe Clemson University Libraries in honor of his mother, Callie Jones Shirley, naming \r\nthe endowment he established for her. \r\nToday, the Callie Jones Shirley Library has grown to more than $1.7 million, and \r\nmost of this has been given by Col. Shirley. The endowment which he created is \r\ncritical to the Libraries' ability to provide much needed information to its users. \r\nHe was one of the first million-dollar donors to Clemson . Being a true philanthro\u0002pist, he lives modestly in order to continue his support to the institution in which he \r\nbelieves - the institution that believed in him more than 50 years ago. \r\nService and loyalty are virtually synonymous with Joe Shirley, as they have been \r\nintegral parts of his life. He believes in Clemson and its mission and has been a \r\nconsistent supporter since his retirement from the military in 1970. \r\nMr. Shirley's support of the Libraries will forever benefit future generations of \r\nstudents, faculty and staff as well as the entire upstate community. His selection of \r\nthe library as an area worthy of support was insightful, as the library supports all \r\nareas of the University. His undeterred loyalty is also shown through his involvement \r\non the College of Liberal Arts Alumni Advisory Committee, the Library Development \r\nAdvisory Committee and the Clemson University Foundation Board of Directors of \r\nwhich he is an honorary member. \r\nFriends know him as an individual of great principle and conviction who invests \r\nhis resources only in organizations and causes in which he believes. Mr. Shirley has \r\nmade a lifelong commitment of service, generosity and loyalty to Clemson, and his \r\nunyielding support, concern and love for the University have been an important part \r\nof its continued success in the development arena. \r\nIn recognition of his remarkable life of service to his country and his support of \r\nand commitment to the highest academic quality of Clemson University, we present \r\nthe honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities, to Joe Shirley.

        "text": "The Academic Procession \r\nThe Academic procession is composed of the faculty, staff, officers, Trustees, and honored \r\nguests of the University. Faculty enter by college and each college is preceded by its marshal, a \r\nsenior faculty member, with the college baton, described under University Regalia. \r\nFollowing the marshal is the college banner bearer. Each banner is a combination of colors that \r\ndeclare the disciplines taught in that college. These colors, which were established by the American \r\nCouncil on Education, are as follows: \r\nCollege Colors Dlsclpllne \r\nAgriculture Maize Agriculture \r\nArchitecture Brown Fine Arts \r\nLilac Architecture \r\nCommerce & Industry Copper Economics \r\nDrab Business \r\nEducation Light Blue Education \r\nEngineering Orange Engineering \r\nForest & Recreation Russet Forestry \r\nResources Sage Green Recreation Education \r\nLiberal Arts Dark Blue Philosophy \r\nWhite Letters & Humanities \r\nCream Social Science \r\nLibrary Lemon Library \r\nNursing Apricot Nursing \r\nSciences Golden Yellow Sciences \r\nStaff Purple & Orange Academic Support \r\nCollegiate faculty follow their banner in order of academic rank wearing academic costumes of \r\nmedieval origin. Those who have received their degrees from institutions outside the United States \r\nwear costumes specified by the awarding institutions. \r\nThe academic costumes of faculty whose degrees are from United States' institutions are specified \r\nby a uniform code maintained by the American Council on Education. Caps are black and are usually \r\nmortar boards with tassels. Doctors of Philosophy wear gold tassels usually of metallic thread; other \r\ndegrees wear black or discipline colors. \r\nThe bachelor's gown is simple and black with long, pointed sleeves. Masters' gowns, also black, \r\nare longer than bachelors. Older gowns have sleeves that terminate at the elbow while those since \r\n1960 have sleeves extended to the wrist. Doctors' gowns are full, with bell-like sleeves. The front is \r\nmarked by velvet panels and the sleeves are marked by three velvet bars. While most gowns are \r\nblack with black velvet, one variation is to replace black velvet with velvet in the discipline color. A \r\nsecond variation is a colored gown usually of the university's colors. \r\nAll hoods specify the level of degree, the type of discipline studied and the awarding institution. \r\nFirst, degree level is signified by the size of the hood with bachelors' smallest, masters' larger, and \r\ndoctors' quite large and of a different shape. Clemson does not award hoods to bachelors. The width \r\nof the velvet trim also conveys the degree. Secondly, the degree is indicated by the color of the trim \r\nedging the hood to form the throat over the gown. The most frequently seen is dark blue, which \r\ndesignates the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Finally, the color of the hood's lining specifies the \r\nawarding institution. The colors are displayed in combinations that are drawn from heraldry. Notice \r\nthat the Clemson University hood is lined with purple through which is an orange chevron (a \"V\"). \r\nAlthough many combinations are duplicated by dozens of insitutions, Clemson is presently the only \r\ninstitution with that registered combination. \r\nThe officers, trustees, and honored guests wear academic, ecclesiastical, or military regalia as set \r\nforth by their professions. They are preceded by the University Marshal. Clad in a gown of office in \r\ngold and purple, the marshal wears no hood and bears the University mace. At the ceremony's close, \r\nthe faculty do not exit as a part bf the recessional but are dismissed, along with students and guests, \r\nwhen the marshal leaves the coliseum. "

        "text": "The University Regalia \r\nThe University mace is the symbolic representation of the whole of \r\nClemson University and must be present at any convocation where the \r\nUniversity, through its delegated members, is acting officially. At any \r\nofficial convocation such as commencement, the University Marshal, \r\ncarrying the mace, precedes the President into the assembly. The mace \r\nrests before the President's chair or speaker's stand throughout the \r\nceremony, and its removal from the assembly at the close of a \r\nconvocation is symbolic of the official withdrawal of the University and, \r\nthus, the close of the proceedings. \r\nThe decorative design of Clemson's mace is derived from the \r\nceremonial maces carried by heads of state and church in the Middle \r\nAges. Its basic clublike shape, however, is much more ancient, probably \r\ngoing back to man's prehistory. It is made of walnut wood and silver, \r\nwith the seal of the University in gold and the University colors \r\nrepresented by insets of cornelian (orange) and amethyst (purple). \r\nAmethyst is also the state stone of South Carolina. \r\nThe Presidential chain and seal is symbolic of the authority vested in \r\nthe office of president by the governing body of the University. Only the \r\nUniversity President may wear it, and while wearing it he speaks for the \r\nwhole body of the institution. Clemson's chain and seal are made of \r\nsilver and gold, and cornelian and amethyst. \r\nThe batons of the college marshals also descend from medieval \r\n\"staffs of office\" which were carried by the senior members of \r\ndepartments of state or church. They display the seal of the University \r\nand the symbolic color of the discipline to which the college belongs. \r\nClemson's batons are made of walnut wood and silver with the various \r\ndisciplines inset with enamel. \r\nThe University regalia were designed and executed by Mr. Robert \r\nEbendorf. Mr. Ebendorf is twice winner of the Tiffany Award and one of \r\nthe most acclaimed goldsmiths of our era. The enamel plaques for the \r\nbatons were executed by the late Professor Marshall C. Bell, and the \r\nlapidary work was executed by the late Mr. C. C. Wilson of Clemson \r\nUniversity. "

The \r\nwhite of the books and the purple of the background designate the \r\nteaching mission of the University as it is achieved through \r\nundergraduate and graduate instruction. \r\nThe upper portion of the shield contains two sets of calipers and \r\nwheat sheaves illustrating the measurement system for research, \r\nas well as Clemson's tradition in agriculture and Extension. The \r\nthree symbols - the books, calipers and wheat sheaves - also \r\nrepresent the humanities, technology and science. \r\nThe entire shield is joined by a small orange center shield \r\nbearing a white tiger mask symbolizing the abiding spirit of \r\nClemson. \r\nThe crest is a gold palmetto tree, which emphasizes Thomas \r\nGreen Clemson's desire that Clemson become \"the people's \r\nuniversity\" for South Carolinians. It rises from a band of purple, \r\norange, white and gold. The outer pair of colors, purple and gold, \r\nare the official colors of the University; the inner pair, orange and \r\nwhite, are Clemson's student colors. "

        "text": "Hlstorlcal Statement \r\nClemson University is named for Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who \r\nleft the bulk of his estate to the State of South Carolina for the founding of the \r\ninstitution. \r\nThomas Clemson was born in Philadelphia in 1807 and educated at the Royal \r\nSchool of Mines in Paris (1828-1832). His early profession was that of a mining \r\nengineer; however, circumstances diverted his interests into politics and the life \r\nof a southern planter, and he soon became an enthusiastic advocate of scientific \r\nagriculture. He had a career as a diplomat (charge d'affairs to Belgium, 1844-\r\n1852) and served as the first Superintendent of Agricultural Affairs in Washington \r\n(1860). As a scientist he published numerous articles in the fields of mining, \r\nchemistry and agriculture. His varied activities included his assistance in the \r\nfounding of the Maryland Agricultural College, his support of the Morrill Act, his \r\nleadership in South Carolina after the Civil War, and his part in founding Clemson \r\nUniversity. \r\nThomas Clemson was the son-in-law of South Carolina's John C. Calhoun, a \r\npolitical figure of national importance during the first half of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Mr. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, is preserved on the Clemson Campus as a \r\nnational shrine. \r\nThe academic program at Clemson College began in 1893 with an enrollment \r\nof 446. The first \"college prospectus\" announced only two four-year curricula, \r\nsupplemented by two two-year preparatory courses. Today the University has \r\nten major academic units. These are the College of Agricultural Sciences, the \r\nCollege of Architecture, the College of Commerce and Industry, the College of \r\nEducation, the College of Engineering, the College of Forest and Recreation \r\nResources, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing, the College of \r\nSciences, and the Graduate School. \r\nThe institution is an accredited member of the Southern Association of \r\nColleges and Schools; various curricula are accredited by the National \r\nArchitectural Accrediting Board, National League for Nursing, Society of \r\nAmerican Foresters, American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, \r\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and National Council for \r\nAccreditation of Teacher Education. \r\nClemson is a land-grant institution. As such, it is engaged not only in its \r\nprimary academic program, but does extensive research at the main campus and \r\nat five agricultural experiment stations located in the State. The University is also \r\nheavily committed to a varied program of public service, including the work of \r\nagricultural extension which has professional personnel located in each of the \r\nState's counties.
